Though it's now confined to spray-painted "tags" on wooden fences and highway overpasses, growing gang activity concerns the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department to the point that officials have assigned an officer to track local gang members. The symbols of gang graffiti &mdash; pitchforks, five-pointed crowns &mdash; are popping up with increasing frequency, particularly in the southwest section of the county. "You're never going to get rid of this stuff," said newly assigned gang investigator Phil Sanders. "But if you know where they are, if you know what they're doing, you can control it."
