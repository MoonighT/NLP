Poor Donald Hollowell. The distinguished civil rights attorney, who died last year, deserved better than to be memorialized along a street synonymous with desperation, poverty and crime. When the state Department of Transportation renamed a stretch of the notorious Bankhead Highway in honor of Hollowell in 1998, it did him no favors. Nor did it make much of an impression on the denizens of the area. It's unlikely the group of nihilistic young thugs who attacked a tanker truck last week &mdash; apparently causing the crash in which driver Rafael Diaz Jr. was seriously injured &mdash; have any idea who Hollowell was. Nor would they care. Of course, simply changing a street name never improves a neighborhood's prospects. Check out the countless Martin Luther King Jr. streets, drives, boulevards and avenues throughout the country. Their near-universal lack of promise makes that clear.
