The Georgia Army National Guard's 48th Brigade is attracting some military heavyweights as it wraps up its preparations for war in Iraq. Gen. Peter Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, flew into this remote desert training base Saturday and met with 48th Brigade officers and soldiers for about 90 minutes. Secretary of the Army Francis Harvey is scheduled to visit Tuesday.
