Fox Chase Cancer Center researchers recommend more aggressive treatment for men whose prostate cancers occurred after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and whose PSA level is considered intermediate. "PSA is secreted from both normal and cancerous tissue.  Patients who have had a TURP prior to their prostate cancer diagnosis may have lower PSA levels because of less prostate tissue remaining.  This can mislead physicians regarding the extent of disease," explained David J. D'Ambrosio, M.D.
