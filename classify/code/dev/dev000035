Two Cherokee County men are undergoing rabies treatment after tangling with a raccoon that later tested positive for rabies. One man was bitten and the second bitten and scratched when the two captured the raccoon Oct. 2 in the Free Home area of north Cherokee County, said Curtis Barnhart of the Cherokee County Health Department. "People need to leave wild animals alone," said Barnhart.
