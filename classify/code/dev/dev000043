A  a nationally developed program to promote awareness of dating violence encountered some unexpected resistance. 

"
Oliver, 54, said she told her ninth-grade students that teen dating violence happens in "any relationship." When some asked if that included gay and lesbian relationships, she said, she answered yes. 

"
She may now be running afoul of the district's policy regarding controversial topics. 

"
Oliver said she borrowed parts of the curriculum that were consistent with the lesson plan she has taught for years about domestic violence. She led discussions on the subject in all six life management skills classes that she teaches. During lunch period, she and Laura Preble, a teacher who advises the school's Gay/Straight Alliance club, distributed material about domestic-violence awareness. 

Oliver said she wasn't promoting homosexuality, only awareness that violence is common in all relationships....

Oliver said Wilbur told her last week that Grossmont Superintendent Terry Ryan was uncomfortable with the same-sex reference in the curriculum and that it was something the district's board, which is dominated by religious conservatives, would not accept. 

Martin said Ryan's discussion with Wilbur focused on the use of an unapproved curriculum, and that the district only learned of the lesson plan after a reporter inquired about it last week. 

"We have very specific guidelines for approving curriculum," she said, adding that teen violence in personal relationships is already covered in the life management skills course. 

Oliver said she didn't think she needed to go through the regular channels because the "Love Is Not Abuse" curriculum was a pilot program meant to be tested, not permanently put in place.

If that is the case, the Christian community ought to chill. ??It is a fact that domestic violence is a more than equal opportunity affair. Women can be perpertrators as well as victims. Lesbian relationships are actually more violent than many kinds of opposite sex relationships. Cohabiting relationships are more violent than marriage. Whether these same patterns hold for dating, is something I am not sure of. But??if all the teacher said was that dating violence takes place in same-sex dating couples, the??Christian community need not be alarmed. 

In fact, it is even possible to use this kind of discussion as a jumping off point for presenting the merits of postphoning sexual activity.?? The violence is probably more apt to take place in dating relationships that have become sexual than in those which have not.
