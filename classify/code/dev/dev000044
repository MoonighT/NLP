 Quote: "The truth of the matter is that Lina Wertmuller, for better or worse, stands out as the one modern female film director whose films are both commercially successful (and accessible to audiences) and yet critically respectable. Not that this should be taken to disparage the work of Lina Wertmuller in any way. It just seems like, well, to drop a cliche, Wertmuller is in a class by herself."
