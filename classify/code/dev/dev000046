Wearing glasses and a blue pants suit, white-haired Juanita Ferguson Edwards stood in Henry County Superior Court on Wednesday and admitted she was a drug dealer. Judge Arch McGarity sentenced Edwards, 79, to five years' probation, giving her first-offender status because  "You've never done anything [wrong] before in your life." "And I won't ever again," she said.
