The waitress took our order and then disappeared. After awhile we went and got a manager, the manager asked who our server was, then told us that she had gone home for the evening. After he put our order in himself, we finally got our food after an hour. Our new waiter was not attentive and we had to go find the manager again who filled up our drinks. The manager never apologized or asked us to come back, and we will not. His name was Jimmy or Johnny or something like that.
