My friend Kristin and I visited ION last Friday night for dinner before heading out to a concert.  The squash almond bisque was amazing!  The dim sum platter was better than ever!  I had the sweet potato enchilades, and those were simply excellent.  She had curried tofu, and couldn't even finish it all (skimpy portions?  no way!).  Everything was presented promptly, was flavorful, and was reasonably priced.  We'll be back!
