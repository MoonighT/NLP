At least 50,000 pounds of groceries will be given away to the needy at 8 a.m. Saturday at the old Maxell Building, 1400 Parker Road, Conyers. Anyone can get in line with "no qualifying" and "no strings attached," organizers say. Four Conyers churches have collected food for the effort: Grace Tabernacle, the Father's House, New Life Victory Center and Agape Evangelistic Church. In March, the churches served an estimated 3,600 people in a similar giveaway. DeKalb Medical official rewarded for civic work
