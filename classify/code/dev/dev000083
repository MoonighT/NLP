They say those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. But you would think it would take more than four years to forget valuable lessons. After the Sept.  11 attacks on the World Trade Center, we realized the necessity of protecting public health in the wake of a disaster. Days after the attacks, the Environmental Protection Agency found that worrisome levels of asbestos, a cancer-causing agent, contaminated parts of lower Manhattan. But that warning never reached the public because the White House edited it out of its news release to speed recovery. Today, 70 percent of the thousands of workers who cleaned up the nearby buildings are sick, many have been left incapacitated and others have died. Doctors predict the related death toll will eventually reach the thousands.
