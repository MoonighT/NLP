IThe FogI is sure to spook young lovers who use the flick as a date movie and is guaranteed to have enough jumpy moments to have that date sitting closer by the end. Hopefully those who use the movie for that purpose will put more time and effort into sucking face then focusing on the movie itself. As a PG-13 horror flick its a sloppy mess. As a remake it makes you wonder why they bothered with a picture that neither honors nor pays tribute to the original.
