Cobb County teachers may yet get laptop computers this school year, despite the derailment of a plan to give take-home laptops to middle and high school students. The fallout of that failure continued Wednesday when Donald Beers, top deputy to former Superintendent Joseph Redden, resigned. Beers, a friend recruited to Cobb by Redden four years ago, had been the target of criticism and said he felt his presence was a distraction as the school board searches for a new leader. Board members came to a consensus Wednesday to not conduct a national search for a successor to Redden. The board already has received several r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and requests for applications. Board members set no timeline to make a decision.
