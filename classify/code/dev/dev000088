The standard of living for America's shrinking manufacturing work force is about to take a significant hit from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by giant auto parts maker Delphi Corp. Unable to negotiate a two-thirds cut in combined wages and benefits from its unionized workers in the United States, the company will use the leverage of U.S. Bankruptcy Court to force the concessions it wants. The effects will ripple through the auto industry and possibly beyond as Delphi reduces its costs to compete globally, setting a pattern for competitors as well as manufacturers in other sectors. Delphi's drastic demands should be a wake-up call for the United States to develop a national manufacturing policy. Without a strong manufacturing base, it will be difficult for many American families to reach &mdash; or even to maintain &mdash; a middle-class standard of life. Delphi's demands and its court filing "signal that the basic wage structure in the United States is probably not sustainable, and not just in manufacturing," said Leslie Hough, research director of the Usery Center at Georgia State University, which conducts workplace research and provides consulting services. It's a "tipping point" for the domestic auto industry and more broadly for "the American standard of living," he suggested.
