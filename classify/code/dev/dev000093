Danny Hayes figures he and other residents are facing an uphill battle in trying to stop a proposed landfill from being approved in north Clayton County. They won't be surprised if the Georgia Environmental Protection Division approves a permit for the landfill, which would be located just north of Flat Shoals Road, near Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. "But we're not going to let this die," Hayes said to cheers Monday during a public hearing on the issue. "This isn't the end. It's the beginning."
