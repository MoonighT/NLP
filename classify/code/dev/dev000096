With gasoline hovering near $3 a gallon, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) is trading his Ford Expedition for a more fuel-frugal vehicle. Govs. Tim Pawlenty (R) of Minnesota and John Baldacci (D) of Maine are giving up their gas-guzzling Chevrolet Suburbans. Gov. Bill Richardson (D) of New Mexico also has promised to switch his Lincoln Navigator for something that gets better fuel mileage. In the wake of the hurricanes and tighter fuel supplies, more governors are asking agencies and residents for energy conservation.
