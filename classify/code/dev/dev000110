Fox Chase Cancer Center researchers say tamoxifen, then radiation following lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer does not affect disease control, survival or complication rates, but administering tamoxifen concurrently with radiation has negative cosmetic results.  "Previous studies have shown that quality-of-life issues such as the appearance of the affected breast after treatment is important.  We continue to recommend sequential sequencing of tamoxifen and radiation, but concurrent administration has acceptable outcomes if required," said Penny Anderson, M.D.
