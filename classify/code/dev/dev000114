The cable system that Acworth officials once hoped would make money for the city will mostly likely be sold at a loss of $8  million or more. Acworth city officials opened three bids for its Cablenet system Wednesday. Comcast submitted the highest bid of $2,000 per subscriber. Cablenet has about 2,700 subscribers, so Comcast's bid could bring Acworth about $5.4 million.
