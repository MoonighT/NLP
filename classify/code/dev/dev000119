The International Atomic Energy Agency and its Egyptian chief, Mohamed ElBaradei, have won the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. The prize, announced Friday, went to the two "for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is used in the safest possible way." In Vienna, where the agency is based, IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Flemming said: "I never thought we'd see this day. This is the proudest day for the IAEA. We are proud, astonished, elated."
