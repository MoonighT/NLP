More than a year after complaining to Tyrone about their muddy lake, homeowners in the Pendleton subdivision are nearing a resolution on the lake's cleanup. Developers, town officials and the Pendleton Homeowners Association agreed in principle last week to share the cost of about $50,000 to dredge the subdivision's 18-acre lake. "We feel very encouraged," said Bill Brown, president of the Pendleton Homeowners Association, following a Sept. 14 meeting in Town Hall. "This is exactly what we had hoped would happen."
