About a month ago, Ronald Hewitt witnessed something out of a bad cop show. He was pulling weeds in his yard on Anderson Avenue when someone stole a car, "took off in it, hit somebody in an SUV," Hewitt recalled. "I called the police, the guy who got hit called the police and the guy whose car got stolen called the police," Hewitt said. "I stopped counting time after 45 minutes. The police rarely get here on time. The mantra is the Police Department is shorthanded and they prioritize crimes. So how low are carjackings?"
