Fayette and Coweta counties undoubtedly will suffer from Delta Air Lines going into bankruptcy, but it could have been worse, according to business and government leaders. Employees have been cutting back for months, bracing for the bankruptcy announcement that came last week. Delta has trimmed staff, cut service and sustained $10 billion in losses over the past four years. The airline plans more salary and benefits cuts and might trim additional staff as it tries to right itself.
