This new documentary was responsible for the Justice Department reopening the case of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old black boy from Chicago who in 1955 went to visit his grandfather in Mississippi and was kidnapped, tortured and killed because he whistled at a white woman. His mother insisted on an open-casket funeral, and a photograph of the mutilated boy in Jet magazine echoed through the years, inspiring Keith Beauchamp to investigate the case for this film. Two white men were acquitted of the crime (they later sold their confessions to Look magazine), but Beauchamp found that 14 people were involved, and five are still alive.
