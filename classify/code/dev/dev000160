South Carolina is one of the only Southern states where the Republican Party has been in control long enough to speak of generations of GOP leadership. Now, there's a generation gap. On the one side are three of the state's top leaders: Gov. Mark Sanford, Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham. On the other are GOP officials who aren't quite ready to see things their way. "The generational thing is pronounced and real," said Sanford, 45.
