To almost quote , "we're dealing with a lot of stuff."

Michelle Malkin thinks Big Lizards is being a little too generous to Laura Bush and the White House, in his defense of the First Lady (mentioned ).

She makes the same point I did-- that the , as illustrated by Ed Gillespie's statements. Folks are not simply mispeaking when they drop the "sexism" bomb. I wish they were, but for some reason, someone in the administration thinks this is a good idea.

Jonah Goldberg , although he's agnostic on the Miers nomination:

"
If we always went with the best resume and nothing else, there would be no political parties because demonstrated loyalty to the team, shared sacrifice, shared principles and hard work wouldn't count for anything. And without that, there'd be no politics at all.

"

"
We all know this president. He's not withdrawing her. He'll take a losing vote before he'll withdraw her name. He expects loyalty from his base; this may be the first time his base isn't giving it to him. So is it better to hold one's fire and see what we get in the hearing?

Inner conflict makes it easy to be humble. I'm glad I don't have to vote on this; right now, I don't know the right course.

, but I could see a woman with a federal judgeship not being terribly keen on putting herself and her family through a confirmation process that means investigations of her children and attacks on her looks in addition to all the fun she would have talking to Joe Biden and Co.

"
And just for the record, Judiciary committee staffers are not the only ones who are upset. From my experience talking with Senate aides, the discord is widespread throughout the caucus. 

This will create significant tension for those staffers with their bosses, who will be under tremendous pressure from the White House to toe the party line.

"
Hugh Hewitt blasts the anonymous staffers, :

"
Finally, I would not jump to the conclusions that Hewitt does. We do not know who leaked this story to the press. We do not know how many acted. It is very possible that this story was leaked by someone who intended it to have very different consequences than meets the eye. 

It is possible that this story was leaked by pro-Miers staff who were aware of negative Miers feelings amongst some Judiciary staffers. The leak would be intended to clamp down on staffers with anti-Miers inclinations. Hugh himself has used the story to call on Senators on the committee to discipline these staff: 

"
Senators Kyl and Senator Brownback, Senators Sessions and Hatch, Senators Cornyn and Coburn and Grassly --are you really going to allow your people to be less honorable than the left?

"
Is somebody trying to muzzle conservative staffers who might persuade their bosses to vote against Miers? Who knows...it is possible. 

"
And, finally, the  the Burger incident of last week.

PowerLine  as the falsehoods leaked from a private meeting between Roberts and Sen. Durbin before Roberts' hearings.

"
The role of Senator Leahy's colleagues or aides in retailing the Warren story -- raising the possibility that Miers may have been referrig to Earl Warren -- seems to me a variation of the role played by Senator Durbin's office in retailing a similarly malicious story about John Roberts. Today's Post story treats the issue as something of a lark, noting that Burger is not highly regarded for anything other than judicial administration -- the matter on which Miers allegedly held him in high regard.
