Afghans voted without significant violence Sunday in their first parliamentary elections in three decades, but signs of low voter turnout revealed frustration with the campaign and the country's slow pace of reconstruction. A mixture of Muslim clerics, warlords and women is expected to win seats in the national parliament and 34 regional ones. The vote count won't begin until Tuesday, and because of the country's rugged terrain, final results are not expected for a month. "Today Afghanistan is moving forward," President Hamid Karzai said as he cast his ballot, "making political institutions."
