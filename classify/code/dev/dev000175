The terrorist warning system in the United States needs an overhaul, because federal and state authorities are not on the same page. Nothing illustrates the dissonance like New York City's mobilization last week for a supposed bombing plot and the independent intelligence-gathering operations set up by some big-city police departments. Mayor Michael Bloomberg deployed thousands of police throughout the city's subway system because of a tip from an informant in Iraq about possible bombings. The head of the FBI in New York was at Bloomberg's side Thursday when the mayor sent officers into the subways to look for bombs secreted in bags or strollers. Yet in Washington, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said that while "the threat information was very specific, it still remains of doubtful credibility." On Tuesday, Newsday and CNN reported that government officials now think the tip was a hoax. The New York Times said doubt was cast on the plot last week.
