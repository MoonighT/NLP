A Texas court issued a warrant for former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay today.  Travis County court officials said DeLay was ordered to appear at the Fort Bend County jail for booking on Friday and that bail was initially set at $10,000. "DeLay is charged with conspiracy to violate state election laws and money laundering, felony counts." DeLay is likely to face the fingerprinting and a photo mug shot, despite pleas from his lawyers that he be spared these routine procedures.

Hussein Pleads Not Guilty in Baghdad Trail

In a courthouse in central Baghdad, Saddam Hussein appeared before an Iraqi judge, a Kurd named Rizgar Muhammad Amin, to face charges for mass executions in 1982.   

The first case being brought against the former Iraqi leader focuses on the execution of more than 140 men and teenage boys from the mostly Shiite market town of Dujail, 35 miles north of Baghdad. The victims were seized by the secret police after a failed assassination attempt on Mr. Hussein there in 1982.

Hussein pleaded not guilty and at times was hostile towards the court.  He also refused to recite his name, stating: "You know me, because you are an Iraqi," Mr. Hussein said, adding, "I don't recognize the parties that appointed you to this court."

Indictments Expected in C.I.A. Leak Probe

The special counsel in the C.I.A. leak case has told associates he has no plans to issue a final report about the results of the investigation.  Thus, it appears as though Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is planning to issue indictments or close his investigation with no public disclosure of his findings, a choice that would set off a political firestorm. Thus, it is widely speculated that indictments are imminent.  

 The focus of Mr. Fitzgerald's inquiry has remained fixed on two senior White House aides, Karl Rove, who is President Bush's senior adviser and deputy chief of staff, and I. Lewis Libby Jr., who is Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff. Both had conversations with reporters about a C.I.A. officer whose name was later publicly disclosed.  It is not clear whether Mr. Fitzgerald has learned who first identified the C.I.A. officer, Valerie Wilson, to the syndicated columnist Robert D. Novak in July 2003.
