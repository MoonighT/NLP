Russian security forces claim control of the southern city of Nalchik, but continue to hunt rebels still at large. Insurgents staged a series of coordinated raids on official buildings in the city earlier in the week, killing at least 100 people, including civilians. Officials blame the attacks on foreigners, but critics say the Kremlin's policy failures in Chechnya and the North Caucasus created the conditions for a widespread local insurgency.
