Rove in Court Today

Today in Washington, DC, Karl Rove made his fourth grand jury appearance in federal court regarding the CIA leak probe.  The New York Times reports that this appearance is "Rove's final chance to convince grand jurors he did nothing criminal in the leak case. Prosecutors have warned the architect of President Bush's 2004 re-election campaign that there is no guarantee he will not be indicted."

The White House no longer categorically denies that Rove or Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis ''Scooter'' Libby, were involved in the leak of a covert CIA officer's identity.  The official line was ''no comment'' today. This contrasts with the words offered in defense of Rove and Libby on October 7th by White House spokesman, Scott McClellan: ''They are good individuals... They are important members of our White House team. And that's why I spoke with them, so that I could come back to you and say that they were not involved."

DeLay's Phone Records Subpoenaed

A Texas prosecutor subpoenaed telephone records for the home phone of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, his political campaign and two numbers for his daughter, Dani DeLay Ferro Thursday.  The prosecutor is seeking the records and information from September 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002, the time period when Texans for a Republican Majority, a political committee founded by DeLay, was raising money for the 2002 election cycle. Bill White, Austin attorney for DeLay, responded, "The thing is no big deal."

Social Security Payments to Rise, But Not Enough to Keep up With Inflation

Social Security payments to more than 50 million retired and disabled workers will rise by 4.1 percent in January to help those recipients keep up with inflation, which rose 1.2 percent last month and 4.7 percent in the 12 months that ended in September.

Hurricane Katrina is blamed for pushing inflation up sharply last month.  Energy costs surged after the deadly storm shut down and damaged oil rigs, refineries and pipelines when it hit Aug. 29.  This added to already mounting energy costs.  In the 12 months that ended in September, energy costs have risen by 35 percent.
