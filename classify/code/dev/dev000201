In ways obvious and hidden, security is getting a bit tighter at the DeKalb County Courthouse. Security improvements were a major feature of the design of the new Judicial Tower, the $35 million annex where courtrooms were relocated in January 2004. No longer would shackled inmates be paraded through narrow hallways. No longer would people walk into judges' offices without passing a locked door. If some courthouse employees grumbled about small public seating areas or balky electronics, everyone seemed satisfied with security arrangements.
