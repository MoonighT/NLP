Candy Addict?sez, "Five weeks ago, Jonathan Coulton (mentioned previously here started a 'Thing A Week' project where he released a new recording each week. This week is his best yet - a cover of Sir Mix-a-lot's Baby Got Back. Hearing a soulful folkie crooning about his 'home boys' and how he 'likes big butts and cannot lie' is absolutely hilarious.? All of his songs are released under a Creative Commons license."
