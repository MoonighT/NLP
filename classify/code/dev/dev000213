The Pendleton Homeowners Association is proposing that five parties pay nearly $9,000 each to help clean up the Tyrone subdivision's muddy lake. In a letter to the town of Tyrone, the Homeowners Association said it would cover about $10,000 of the $55,000 cost to dredge Pendleton Lake. The association proposed that the remaining $45,000 be divided among developers and projects that may be responsible for the excess silt. "It is important for all parties to participate in this resolution because partial involvement will mean a shortage of funds and our inability to provide the silt retention ponds we need to prevent this problem in the future," wrote association President Bill Brown. "I don't think anybody wants to revisit this situation in another four to five years."
