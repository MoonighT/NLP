Thurman does her best to pick up the slack left by IPrimeI disinterested script, but shes left running in place.  Worst is the pivotal miscasting of the movies lead.  Brian Greenberg is not a talent, hes a big waste of space.  So is the movie by the way, and its not worth sticking with it as it drags on and on, forgetting to laugh and struggling to find an inoffensive way to finish.  Its a go nowhere do nothing movie.  Go somewhere, do something better than spending time with IPrimeI.
