THE FOOD HERE WAS OUTSTANDING! It was absolutley delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to have the pleasure of enjoying an authentic and tasty Italian meal. The chicken piccata was unbelievable. I will most certainly continue to return to this restaurant with my family, and recommend it to my friends. =).
