Their marriage was unorthodox, but it seemed to work: George Lathbury having his affairs, wife Elizabeth having hers. Him carrying on.  Her carrying on. Them carrying on &mdash;  for 26 years. Then in April, what George and Elizabeth had, what connected them, began to come unglued. And what happened a few months later was worse. On the night of July 4, Elizabeth, authorities say, shot George three times in the head with a .38-caliber revolver as he slept in their bed. The shooting coincided with a fireworks display at nearby Georgia International Horse Park, so neighbors wouldn't hear the blasts.
