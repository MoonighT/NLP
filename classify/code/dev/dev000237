Nice little dive diner right off I-57 in Gilman.  You don't see many places like this anymore.  It's a full service truck stop and the restaurant serves up exactly what you'd expect.  Greasy burgers, eggs, pancakes and any other diner fare you would want from such a place.It's someplace I enjoy a lot....these are my kind of estbalishments.  Very friendly wait staff not trying to push you out the door.
