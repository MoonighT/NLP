Two men have been convicted and sentenced to life in a fatal home invasion nearly two years ago at a south Fulton County apartment complex. The fatal break-in was recorded on a frantic 911 phone call and played for a Fulton Superior Court jury, which Thursday convicted Thomas McCoy, 20, and Michael Favors, 17, of murder, felony murder, aggravated assault, theft by receiving stolen property, burglary and possession of a pistol in commission of a felony. Erik Friedly, spokesman for District Attorney Paul Howard, said Favors, tried as an adult, was also convicted of aggravated assault on a police officer as he attempted to flee the crime in a car. He received an additional 15 consecutive years on that charge.
