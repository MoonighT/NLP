Absolutely devine!!  Such an establishment should be the norm, great customer service! The entire staff was attentive, knowledgable of their product and completely courteous.  The pizza, wings and calzone our family had was the best I've had in many years, if not the best overall.  Recommended A+ and a very clean place, I will be a Bambino's customer for a very long time!!!  -L. Van London 14 Oct 2005.
