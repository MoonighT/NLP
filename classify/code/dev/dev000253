So far, looking for progress in eliminating  unfair farm subsidies has been like watching corn grow: Change is invisible to the naked eye. This year, American taxpayers will spend about $14 billion  on farm subsidy programs that accomplish little. As U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman noted last week,  other countries are complaining loudly about those subsidies, and so are critics here at home. As domestic critics point out, most farm subsidy payments go to large agriculture operations instead of to the small farmers who were supposed to reap the benefits of such programs. The subsidies increase land prices, encourage overproduction and lead to the  dumping of excess agricultural products on the world market, undercutting struggling  farmers in less-developed countries.
