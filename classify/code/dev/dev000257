Decatur schools will operate Monday,  with all students and staff to report. Monday had been scheduled to be a teacher workday, but Superintendent Phyllis Edwards said it will be used instead to make up for one of two days lost last month when the school system closed, as most did statewide, at the request of the governor. The second missed day will be made up Jan. 4, Edwards said. New concert series to begin Saturday Roberta Flack and Melba Moore will perform Saturday night in the first of a new concert series at Stone Mountain Stadium. The stadium, previously the Stone Mountain Tennis Center, was built next to the mountain to house tennis events for the 1996 Olympic Games.
