A 9-year-old girl walking to church was struck and killed before dawn Sunday while trying to cross a busy DeKalb County road, police said. Hannah Lewis was among a group of about six children, ages 9 to 17, who were walking on Flat Shoals Road near Panthersville Road when she was struck shortly before 7 a.m., county police Officer Herschel Grangent said. Police determined that the vehicle's driver, who stopped after the incident, was not to blame, but the investigation continues.
