In the latest saga of "As the Goalie Turns," the Thrashers sent rookie Adam Berkhoel down to the Chicago Wolves (AHL) on Monday and invited veteran Steve Shields for a tryout. He could be signed if he is in shape. Mike Dunham (groin), who appeared last Saturday as if he could have been activated early this week, has now been surpassed by Kari Lehtonen (groin/core muscles) in his recovery, general manager Don Waddell said. Coach Bob Hartley said he expected Michael Garnett to make his second career start in goal on Thursday when defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay visits Philips Arena.
