Army officials responsible for ensuring Georgia National Guard soldiers are properly prepared for the war in Iraq are giving the unit high marks for its last dress rehearsal. Final certification of the combat readiness of the 48th Brigade Combat Team is expected in about two weeks. But trainers here at the National Training Center say Georgia's citizen-soldiers came well-trained and will leave even better-prepared to face the rigors of combat. "This is a good unit. I'd go to war with them," said Brig. Gen. Robert Cone, commander of this sprawling desert training center.
