 Quote: "Lynn is widely regarded as a national treasure thanks to her largely autobiographical songs, intelligence, and irresistible backwoods charm. Her story was given the big-screen treatment in 1980's crowd-pleasing, Academy Awarding-winning Coal Miner's Daughter, an entertaining, stunningly performed film that falls just short of being a certified classic."
