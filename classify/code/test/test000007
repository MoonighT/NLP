A flurry of cellphone calls placed about the time Sueann Ray disappeared six weeks ago is one of many avenues police are exploring as they seek to solve the mysterious disappearance of the 26-year-old Woodstock mother. The review of calls between her estranged husband, Quinton Ray, and his family are among a number of police activities that have come to light since the case fell under a national spotlight over the weekend when her friend and family posted a $105,000 reward. "We have looked at the cellphone records of Quinton Ray and others and we continue to look into cellphone records," Woodstock police Sgt. Dan King said Thursday. While acknowledging that many phone calls were placed between Quinton Ray and his family in a short time, King declined to detail their number or scope.
