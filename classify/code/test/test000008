It wasn't your typical weekend at the beach. Instead of treading barefoot on silver sands, the group of 23 volunteers from Duluth slogged in work boots through ankle-deep muck. No pina coladas were passed around at sunset. Rather, they ate a breakfast bar in the morning and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches for lunch. Instead of hammocks on the porch, they slept on the floor of a church building.
