Tornado-damaged Tara Field is about to get a quick makeover. Clayton County officials have approved a plan to demolish hangars at the county's airport and repair the facility's administrative offices &mdash; all before a major Nextel Cup race at the nearby Atlanta Motor Speedway next month. "We're going to have a significant number of planes coming in and out for the race," said Clayton Commission Chairman Eldrin Bell. "It's a huge day for us and I want our [airport] serviceable for our customers."
