With a brilliantly talented cast, how could the movie go so wrong? The fault lies with writerdirector Craig Lucas, who never decides if hes making a classic tragedy or a modern day satire. I never figured out exactly what this movie is about, or what kind of statement its trying to make. Watching three people who behave like sociopaths take turns seeing who can be the most immoral is an unlikely way to win over your audience.
