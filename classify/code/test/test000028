Henry County police traffic investigators will be closing two southbound lanes of I-75 Tuesday for two hours while they take measurements for an accident that happened last week. The closing will be at mile marker 224 in Stockbridge beginning at 10 a.m. Only the right lane will be open for travel. Motorists should expect delays. &mdash; Kathy Jefcoats
