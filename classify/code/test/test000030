The mother and sister of an alleged Clayton County gang leader pleaded guilty Monday to lying to federal agents investigating his involvement in the 2004 shooting death of a toddler at a Riverdale park. Lawanna Davis, 43, and her daughter, Natasha Anthony, 24, both of Riverdale, entered an Alford plea as first offenders to making false statements, Clayton Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney John Turner said. An Alford plea means the defendant maintains their innocence but believes the state can present enough evidence at trial to ensure a conviction. Davis' son, Cori Davis, 21, is the leader of the Southside Mafia, Turner said, and is being held in the Clayton County Jail on a murder charge in the June 6, 2004, shooting death of Trevon Wilson, 4. Wilson was playing in the park with his grandmother, Glenda Darville, when he was caught in the crossfire of two rival gangs, police said. The park has been renamed in his memory.
