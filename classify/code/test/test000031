Americans of European descent like to ask each other where they are from; meaning, what part of Europe did your ancestors leave? But, with the lives of my ancestors so connected to the settlement of this region, and with the fifth and sixth generations of my family now growing up here, it seems absurd to think of any other place as home. Then again, we're all fresh off the boat compared with someone like Bobbie Conner, whose people have been in this land for as long as 500 generations.
