The first clue that we were not about to experience fine dining was when the hostess held up her hand, as if to say "STOP!" We had made a reservation, at least one week in advance. We had done so because we were a large party-13. We were celebrating  a family reunion and a 21st birthday. The table, or should I say tables, because they refused to accommodate our party by putting 2 tables together, were not ready. Let me add, in case anyone is wondering, there were no young children in our party.  The youngest were 15 and 16.  Everyone was dressed appropriately, "business casual." It was an early Thurday evening.The house wine was very good, though overly priced. Between the two tables we had 5 glasses of wine and one beer. The rest of the party drank soft drinks or water.  The steak was of obvious good quality but the portions were small and served luke-warm, at best. The sauce smothering it was tasty but instead of enhancing the flavor of the beef, it disguised it. The menu is a la carte, so the diner is as likely to loss his bank account at the dining table as the roulette table and  leave broke,hungry, and sober to boot!The service was nothing to speak about. In fact, the waitress had put a portion of broccoli on our table. We thought this was something the House did. Luckily, no one went to taste it, either with fork or finger, because several minutes later, the waitress removed it from our table stating that "it was put here by mistake!"In sum, the meal which cost us over $800, was our biggest mistake. Emeril should be ashamed of himself. The Venetian, a very beautiful hotel should think twice about renewing this lease.
