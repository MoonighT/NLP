The Fulton County schools superintendent is backing away from a financing technique that could have provided as much as $200 million more for school construction during the next two years. Initially, Superintendent James Wilson expected to put an option of a "lease-purchase" for new construction before the school board at its meeting tonight. But last week, Wilson said he instead will recommend a significant scaling-back on using borrowed money. The board instead will be asked to approve up to $20 million, possibly to be taken from a building reserve, to continue to acquire land and complete designs for several schools and additions.
