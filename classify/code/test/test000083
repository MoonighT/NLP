There are hundreds of folks in Woodstock who call Kevin Edmonds "Pastor Kevin." He presides over their funerals and weddings. He leads them in Bible study and fellowship gatherings. The unusual thing about the 27-year-old is that he's not senior pastor of a specific congregation. His "sheep" are his neighbors in Shadowood, a community of approximately 500 mobile homes. His ministry is in the neighborhood where he, wife Charity and their two small children have chosen to live. Edmonds, who is director of community and special events ministries for First Baptist Woodstock, became involved with Shadowood residents when he joined the staff five years ago and began leading the community's elementary students in Bible study in the neighborhood clubhouse. He also led a program for the teens called "The Wood," a weekly gathering that offered youth a safe place to hang out.
