Combined Rating: 97% (S:97%; P:98%) - One of the markings of a masterpiece is how it stands against the test of time.  Over a decade has passed and The Nightmare Before Christmas popularity has snowballed.  I still see a woman at school always wear a sweater for the movie.  In recent years, an ambitious videogame, Kingdom Hearts, a joint effort between the minds of Disney and Square Enix, was released.  In it, the characters traveled to all the different worlds of Disney animations.  The greatest accomplishment was easily Halloween Town, where the environment looked not just similar to the world in the movie, but a living reincarnation of it.  It came as no surprise to learn that Jack Skellington was specifically chosen to join the main cast for the sequel, due out this spring.  But this is not the only videogame Jack will be appearing in.  The recently released videogame The Nightmare Before Christmas:  Oogies Revenge, serves as a sequel to the original story.  Accompanied with an explosion of merchandise you find at Hot Topic and the millions of items on eBay and Amazon (including pillow cases, costumes, and even mugs), The Nightmare Before Christmas has proven itself to be a classic.
As though having one brilliant movie wasn't enough, the special edition DVD of The Nightmare Before Christmas comes not only with an amazing selection of deleted scenes, storyboards, and documentaries, it also comes with two short works by Tim Burton.  The first  is Vincent, a chilling, animated tribute to the late Vincent Price (who actually narrates).  The second is Frankenweenie, a goofy spin-off of Frankenstein involving a child and his dog.  
I have been writing this review for over a month.  Personal osbtacles aside, this is one of the movies that makes reviewing such an equally delightful but challenging task.  When you are lucky enough to experience a film of such greatness, attempts at praise never quite do as much justice as youd like and you find yourself always wanting to say more.
