The Mall at Stonecrest continues to generate economic steam on several fronts, with construction proceeding on homes, offices, stores, restaurants and hotels. The workers swarming over the mall site near the DeKalb-Rockdale county line hope to finish most of these jobs by December, in time to catch most of the Christmas shopping season, said Sarah Kendall, development director for Cadillac Fairview, the Toronto-based investment company that helped open the mall in October 2001. "Growth is not slowing," Kendall said.
