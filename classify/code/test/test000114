There's no telling how many pairs of running shoes Joe Maloy has worn out. He started running 38 years ago, as a way to lose weight. Back then, before jogging really took off, some people weren't too kind when they saw a man running for the fun of it. "People would yell at you out windows and sometimes throw a drink bottle at you," recalled Maloy, 81. "And sometimes I got run off the road."
