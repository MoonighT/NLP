On Monday, several homeless advocates went to the Atlanta City Council to insist that the poor have the right to panhandle. The Rev. Ed Loring &mdash; who runs the homeless-friendly Open Door Ministry on Ponce de Leon Avenue &mdash; and others demanded that the council drop plans for a new ordinance to outlaw panhandling in certain downtown areas. While they achieved at least a temporary victory, persuading the council to table the ordinance, their strategy seems peculiar. Do homeless advocates help the poor and homeless by defending their right to beg? Shouldn't they be more concerned with helping the poor find employment that prevents the need for begging? The Rev. Loring and his compatriots, including the Rev. Richard Cobble, a vice president of Concerned Black Clergy, are behind the curve, fighting the previous battle. Because they have misread the future, they have missed the chance to home in on the issues that should concern them &mdash; including the disappearance of low-cost housing in the city.
