 I am appalled and angered by William J. Bennett's statement that if we wanted to reduce crime, we could abort every black baby [news story, Sept. 30]. While he went on to say that this was "impossible, ridiculous and morally reprehensible," his original statement produced imagery that sticks in people's minds and is enormously demeaning and insulting.
