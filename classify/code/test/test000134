After three months in an apartment complex near the heart of Sandy Springs, Adam Ritchie is tired of fearing for his wife's safety. Not a week goes by when he doesn't receive a note from the landlord about the latest burglary or car break-in. Somebody was held up at gunpoint two weeks ago. "We don't go out at night," says Ritchie, a restaurant manager.
