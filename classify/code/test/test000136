 Henry Brinton characterized the intelligent design movement as religion in contrast to science [Outlook, Sept. 18]. But proponents of intelligent design limit themselves exclusively to scientific arguments. For example, Michael Behe in "Darwin's Black Box" and agnostic Michael Denton in "Evolution: A Theory in Crisis" make no theological arguments against Darwinism. Instead, they contend that natural selection is incapable of producing what we see, and their scientific arguments need to be countered by other scientific arguments rather than being dismissed as religion.
