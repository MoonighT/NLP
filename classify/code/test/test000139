An Unfair Deal to New Orleans' Establishments

 The nightlife in New Orleans is know to get rolling late&#151;and Katrina hasn't change this feature of life.  Bars have been doing most their business from 11:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. as cleanup crews and insurance adjusters finish their days.

But on Tuesday, the city began a curfew crackdown in the Quarter, which begins shortly after midnight.  A police cruiser crept down Bourbon Street, its lights flashing, broadcasting "Midnight to 6 a.m. curfew is in effect... If you are not inside your hotel, you will go to jail." Officers arrested seven people for violating curfew.

Bar owners are upset, saying that the curfew makes it impossible to recover economically.  Earl Bernhardt, owner of six French Quarter establishments, said:

"The mayor asked us to get the French Quarter rolling and show the city we're open for business, then they turn around and do this to us. If you're going to restrict us like that, we might as well put the plywood back up."
" 

We need a coherent set of policies that brings life back to the Big Easy.
