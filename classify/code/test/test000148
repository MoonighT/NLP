Twelve years ago, Bill Phillips left his job at a television station and moved to another entertainment form. Phillips first opened a comic book store in Griffin. The store was a success from the start. Now Phillips, 37, has opened a second store, Bunjee's Comics, in the developing area on Jonesboro Road in McDonough. The store is close to the movie theaters set to open in November. Phillips said he has a variety of customers &mdash; some collectors and many readers.
