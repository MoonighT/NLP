A Powder Springs woman used a disconnected cellphone to call 911 as she and her three children were being terrorized Sunday by her husband, who later was found dead in the home, police said. April Doctor-Smalls used the out-of-service phone to call police about 1 a.m. Sunday after her husband had disabled the home's phones and taken her regular cellphone, a Cobb County police spokesman said. Police said the woman discovered the old cell phone as her husband, William Smalls III, stormed around the house, firing a handgun.  By federal law, all cellphones must be able to reach a 911 operator, even if they aren't associated with a paid service.
