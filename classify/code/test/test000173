IDominoI is exactly as advertised, and considering the annoying nature of its trailers thats not a good thing.  I am a bounty hunter declares Keira Knightley for the first of a dozen times at the movies opening.  Keira, as Domino Harvey, narrates throughout the film, her voice inexplicably filtered to make it sound like shes reporting the weather over a bad cell phone connection.
