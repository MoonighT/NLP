NRO'S LOGIC: An emailer makes a good point: 
[The NRO editorial] even more bizarre than you claim.  Consider: "If the president withdrew the nomination, we believe that he would seek a replacement who could unite conservatives - as he no doubt expected Miers to unite them. But that nominee would be tarnished, perhaps fatally, by the suspicion that the president was forced to pander to the Right."  But the first sentence makes clear that NRO does want Bush to "pander to the Right" -- they just want him to do it sub rosa and untraceably.
"That's certainly the impression. But maybe my bullying point is a little unfair. Another emailer comments: 
 The NR can't "bully" anyone. It is a magazine. They have no authority - only the power of persuasion.  The last time I looked, engaging in that is called exercising one's First Amendment rights. (Or does your occasional stridency make you a bully too?)
"Point taken. What I was trying to say is that it isn't a nominee's responsibility to withdraw. And she cannot really defend herself right now. It may well have been a bad decision, but she deserves a hearing. Bully the president, not her.
