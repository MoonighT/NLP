. Rory Gilmore was helping her grandmother plan a Daughters of the American Revolution benefit for the troops. They were having trouble selling out the seats for the event and Rory suggested spending a little more money on marketing to make the event a success. 

Here's the exchange:

Rory: "In any business endeavor, sometimes it makes sense to run a deficit in order to achieve a bigger pay-off later."

Random DAR member: "Oooh, we're lunching with Grover Norquist!"

Gilmore Girls is prone to making political references. During the 2004 election, they were pretty run-of the-mill-- picking on George Bush and taking cheap shots at the Swift Boat Vets-- but lately they've gotten a little more sophisticated. 

A couple of weeks ago, Rory's grandmother suggested that she and her husband "call Scooter Libby" for a favor "before an indictment comes down." In the same scene, Rory's grandfather mentioned Ann Coulter. 

Tonight, the episode featured Rory's trust-fund-baby college roommate, who had just lost access to her parents' dough and had to come face-to-face with her first job. After working as a waitress for about an hour, she started spouting Marxist theories and bemoaning the plight of the downtrodden working class under the thumb of capital-controlling pigs.

Rory, who has held a job before, just rolled her eyes. My thoughts exactly, Rory.
