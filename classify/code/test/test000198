 Last night Jonah Goldberg diagnosed himself and members of his ilk as sufferers of Mm'Doh!: "Miers Mental Dementia Obsessive Hysteria." Symptoms may include lumping together contradictory psychological disorders for cute acronym purposes, and making reference to the following in a single NRO column:

&#x2022; "Cheez Whiz-sucking Joe Six-Packs"

&#x2022; "schoolmarms"

&#x2022; "Federalist phantasms [declaring,] 'keep 'em barefoot and in the West Wing.'"

&#x2022; Ed Gillespie in a "tie-dyed muumuu, [setting] fire to a very sensible bra..."

&#x2022; "American womyn"

&#x2022; George Will using handpuppets

&#x2022; hurling oneself onto the keyboard like the "Phantom of the Opera to bang out an evil melody about the president's folly."

&#x2022; The Longest Yard

&#x2022; peach cobbler

&#x2022; St. Vitus's dance

&#x2022; Saudi royal concubines

&#x2022; Howard Fineman of Newsweek

Sorry, Jonah. We can't help those who don't first learn to help themselves.  --MICHAEL WEISS
