A woman died Thursday after falling out of a golf cart in Peachtree City and striking her head on the asphalt path, becoming the first person killed in a cart accident since the town was founded 46 years ago. Debra Overholt, 36, of Tyrone was riding in the front seat of a cart driven by her brother-in-law, Luis Sanchez-Montanez of Peachtree City. They were on their way to pick up their sons, both 3, from school before going to a park. "She was my best friend and I loved her so much," Sanchez-Montanez said Friday between sobs, holding his arms across his chest and rocking back and forth on the sofa in his living room. "I feel so guilty because I was driving."
