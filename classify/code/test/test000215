Book Reviews: It's unusual that a book on a film director should actually evoke its subject's oeuvre, but this long-awaited and much-anticipated debut trawl through legendary auteur Kubrick's extraordinarily vast archives impressively does just that. Like Kubrick's films, it's immense -- it weighs 14 pounds and comes in its own carrying case -- imperious, sumptuous, marvellously detailed, consistently fascinating and captivating to look at, ultimately leaving all previous books on the man firmly under its (considerable) shadow.
