The team and players' names tell you most of what you need to know about women's roller derby. The rosters of the Denim Demons, Apocalypstix and Sake Tuyas feature skaters Demi Gore, Susan B. Agony and Destructiva, among others. They don't go in for that dainty lady stuff; they want to knock someone's block off while speeding along a flat track on roller skates. They had their chance Sunday evening at All-American Skating Center on Bermuda Road in Stone Mountain, which hosted a Halloween-themed "Derby of the Damned," subtitled "Dead Things Can't Skate."
