Gov. Schwarzenegger is calling the Nov. 8 special election a "sequel" to the recall vote that elected him two years ago. Hollywood libs, however, are working to defeat Schwarzenegger's ballot initiatives, and some are even thinking of running for governor themselves.

Sen. John Kerry was in California this week to campaign against Proposition 75, a proposal to require public employee unions to get annual written permission from their members before spending their dues on political causes. 

On the other side of the aisle, Sen. John McCain visited the Golden State to support Prop. 75. 

In a recent poll of 600 registered voters, 49% supported Prop. 75 and 43% opposed.

National Right to Work is protecting California worker's rights against compulsory union dues. 

Other ballot proposals include a parental notification abortion law, an attempt to give redistricting power to a panel of retired judges, changes in teacher tenure standards, and a change in prescription drug policy. 

The redistricting proposal is intriguing. In 2004, not a single incumbent lost in California. That's not right. And yet there is skepticism among conservatives that turning over anything to a group of judges is never a good thing. Libs are merely worried about a short-term loss of power. Ohio is considering a similar proposal.
