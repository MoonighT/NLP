I've been a connoisseur of Thai cuisine for the last 12 years and Thai Pikul offers the most authentic and flavorful dishes I've had yet. They've recently opened a month ago and I've been frequenting the place on a regular basis. Positive things that I've noticed include a large variety of dishes that are freshly prepared (with no MSG), they have a very friendly/attentive wait staff, and they are conveniently located as well as reasonably priced. All Thai food lovers should stop by and try one of their wonderful dishes and enjoy the ambient atmosphere... You will not be disappointed.
