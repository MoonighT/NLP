Five lucky designs have filtered their way through the 1,500 or so suggestions for our Washington state coin, expected to debut in spring 2007. The final choices may ring a bit familiar: a salmon, Mount Rainier, an apple within an outline of Washington state, an outline of Washington state with Mount Rainier centered, a salmon breaching the water with Mount Rainier as a backdrop and a Northwest Native American stylized orca. If only someone had suggested using Mount Rainier in some way.
