An immigration memo written by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), intended for White House adviser Karl Rove, recently arrived instead on the fax machine of a Democratic congressman. The memo, which was intended to be confidential, focuses on the politics of immigration. Smith, a vocal immigration restrictionist, is a member of the subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims. In the memo, Smith states: "Immigration needs to be considered in the context of: (1) media bias, (2) animosity toward the president and (3) the feelings of the Republican base. All three should be considered when deciding how to proceed on immigration legislation."
