Another school year has come and gone. The headlines that dominated the academic year were usually about school boards and administrators doing, well, what they always seem to do. DeKalb County fired a superintendent, paid him off to the tune of nearly a half million dollars, then hired a new superintendent &mdash; all on the same night. Fulton County got rid of its chief as well. Clayton County's school board finally seems to be getting out of the accreditation doghouse for interfering too much in day-to-day school operations. And Cobb's school board ended the year by hiring temporary workers, some of them students, to scrape 34,000 stickers declaring evolution to be a "theory, not a fact" off science textbooks &mdash; the result of a federal court order that said its bullet-headed evolution declaration violated the U.S. Constitution.
