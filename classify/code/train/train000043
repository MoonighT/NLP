Yes, Platinum Poker is new, but already known!  Known with easy to win games, great torunaments and free rolls this room is going to be one of the best. Player traffic is decent, on peak hours about 800-900 cash game players and 2000-2500 tournament players, but most of the tournament players are playing free-rolls.
