Sep 30, 2005: "A History of Violence" is a family drama with guns, graphic gore and explicit sex that's not fit for the whole family. Nor is it recommended to people of any age easily offended by such borderline NC-17 goings-on. Some may head for the exits faster than a speeding hollow-point before the end of the second reel (and some did at a recent local screening).
