Outstanding sandwhiches and pizza.  The grinders (sandwiches) are usually overflowing with toppings and they're cooked....not nuked in a microwave, but actually sent through the oven just like the pizza's, so the bread comes out with an amazing flavor.The price is a little high.  It's cheaper to go to Subway, but if your looking for great food, you'll definately want Mancino's
