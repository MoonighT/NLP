Morrow voters will take part in something they haven't experienced in recent years &mdash; a contested City Council election. There have only been two since the early 1990s. Most Morrow incumbents rarely have opposition. This year, political newcomer Dorothy Brandon will challenge four-year council veteran Virlyn Slaton for his seat. Incumbent Bob Huie has no opposition.
