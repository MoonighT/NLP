The boundaries are blurring between "Old Clarkston" and "New Clarkston" in this mayoral election in Georgia's most ethnically diverse city. Incumbent Lee Swaney said he represented "Old Clarkston" when he first ran for public office &mdash; the City Council, 15 years ago. But he said he wants a second term as mayor of the central DeKalb city of 7,231 because he knows how to build coalitions among the city's many racial and ethnic groups, and he wants to oversee a planned makeover of downtown.
