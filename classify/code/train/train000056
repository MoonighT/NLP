Georgians have spent the last few months nervously watching gasoline prices. But as winter nears, many of us will soon face an even bigger potential economic wallop: rising home heating prices. The numbers are sobering. The Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority predicts that homeowners will see home heating bills rise 60 percent to 65 percent. And that's compared to last year's already-high prices. A colder-than-predicted winter or a slower-than-expected recovery from this year's hurricane season could make even these predictions seem rosy. Rising energy prices threaten to leave many families struggling to make ends meet. Demands for heating assistance (coupled with higher costs to heat and light government buildings) will strain state budgets. And the entire economy could be hurt if consumers find themselves with less disposable income to spend.
