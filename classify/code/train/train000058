 Quote: "Although I haven't read Count Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, it was immediately evident that there's a lot missing here. A quick check of the novel's plot on Wikipedia reveals that tons of material (including an out-of-wedlock pregnancy) was lost, between the condensation of an epic novel into 93 minutes and the restraints of the Hays Code."
