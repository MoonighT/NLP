The deep whirlpools of warm water that revved up hurricanes Katrina and Rita remain in the Gulf of Mexico, meteorologists warned Monday. In fact, because of Rita, there now appear to be more of these giant eddies in the gulf than before, said University of Miami oceanographer Nick Shay. The eddies are spun off by the Loop Current, a slug of warm water that sloshes into the Gulf of Mexico from the Caribbean each summer.
