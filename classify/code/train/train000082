Henry County school officials proposed new attendance zones for three schools under construction in the eastern part of the county to relieve crowding. The school board voted Monday to accept public comments on the zones for an elementary, middle and high school for the next 60 days. The board will consider the comments and decide on the zones in December. The schools are set to open next fall.
