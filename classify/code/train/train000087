Regarding the Register&#146;s Oct. 9 and 10 articles on what others across the nation don&#146;t know about Iowa:

Most of the nation probably doesn&#146;t know that in a state that boasts about education, voter turnout in school board elections often is under 10 percent.

Most of the nation probably doesn&#146;t know that in a state that ballyhoos itself as the best place to pick presidential candidates, voter turnout in local elections often is under 10 percent.

Most of the nation probably doesn&#146;t know about the awful condition of our public lakes and waterways.

We need to clean up our acts more than we need to inform others about the virtues of Iowa.
