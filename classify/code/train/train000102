Paul Green is a walking hypocrite. He talks about his love of teaching, how some people are born for certain things and he, The Paul Green, was born to teach. That segment happens early in IRock SchoolI, and then is quickly followed up by Paul yelling at kids to get out, cussing severely, slamming doors, and throwing chairs. In doing so, he takes out his feelings of musical inadequacy on these nine to seventeen year olds that just wanna play, man. Its eighty-five minutes of Green having temper tantrums, five minutes of back slapping good jobs in the face of an audience, and three minutes of credits.
