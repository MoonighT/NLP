Samuel King, Rockdale County's first black school superintendent, will be introduced in a forum at 7 p.m. Monday at Rockdale County High School, 1174 Bulldog Circle, in Conyers. After a general session, forum participants will move into small groups to  provide feedback for King on the system's strengths and weaknesses. Similar forums have already been held at the county's other two high schools. King, 42, starts his new job July 1. He replaces departing Superintendent Ruel M. Parker, who retires at the end of June after 34 years in the Rockdale school system. Parker had been superintendent since 1999.
