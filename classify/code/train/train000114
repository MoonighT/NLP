Coweta County voters Tuesday approved a record $130 million sales tax-for-schools plan, which is expected to alleviate overcrowding in the small but fast-growing school system. "I think this is the smartest way to go," said Marvin Mc- Koy, a supporter of the plan who helped campaign on the issue. "As rapidly as the county is growing, we've got to build schools for that growth." According to unofficial results, about 86 percent voted to extend the 1 percent sales tax for education, which expires in June 2007, for another five years. About 14 percent of voters responded "No" with a majority of precincts counted.
