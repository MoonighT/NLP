Whoa, if our tipsters are indeed in the reality-based community, the suspect list of possible indict-ees in the Plame investigation is more far reaching than we thought. Though, actually, what's really depressing is how, at this point, plausible some of them are. Also, thanks to those who reminded us that each individual can receive multiple indictments, and considering all the charges -- "obstruction, perjury, false statements; Conspiracy to commit underlying offense x, conspiracy to commit underlying offense y, underlying offense x, underlying offense y...You could get 22 from just Rove and Libby alone."

So, adding to <a href="George Tenet, Porter Goss and/or

Harriet Miers">this list:

&bull;  Condoleezza Rice

&bull;  Stephen Hadley

&bull;  Andrew Card

&bull;  Alberto Gonzales

&bull;  Mary Matalin

&bull;  Scott McClellan

&bull;  Dan Bartlett

&bull;  Colin Powell

&bull;  Karen Hughes

&bull;  John Bolton

&bull;  George Tenet

&bull;  Porter Goss 

&bull;  Harriet Miers

&bull;  Robert Novak

&bull;  A ham and cheese sandwich.

We'll be reviewing the cases against all of these folks, and hope to mine the collective, er, "intelligence" of the Wonkette readership with a poll on the matter come Monday.  -- WONKETTE
