An Ellenwood man who was mistakenly released from Atlanta's city jail has been indicted on vehicular homicide charges after a deadly crash that killed a couple fixing a flat tire. Fulton County sheriff's deputies began looking for John Wesley Shy, 60, after a grand jury handed down the nine-count indictment Friday. The indictment includes charges of first-degree vehicular homicide plus other assorted charges, such as driving under the influence and reckless driving.
