 Quote: "What a woman! As sad as it is to be a movie critic and be ignorant of Garbo, now I see what the fuss is about. Is she melodramatic? Indeed. Angst and sorrow pour from her face like the waters of life seeping down the drain. Her thickly accented, dusky voice sounds like a rake being dragged over gravel. Yet I yearned to hold her close, to put a finger to her lips and tell her it would be okay."
