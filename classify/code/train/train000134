That's what Red State calls the Coburn Amendment.  The Coburn Amendment may prove to be a historic rallying point for the forces of limited government and fiscal sanity.  Then again, it may not.  But it's a good place to start.  The amendment is very simple:  it proposes to redirect the ridiculous $220 million earmarked for the Alaskan "bridge to nowhere" to Hurricane Katrina relief; specifically, reconstruction of the Twin Spans Bridge that connects New Orleans with Slidell, Louisiana.

Red State says that the "Bridge to Nowhere" will cost enough to buy every one of the 50 residents of Gravina Island a Lear Jet.  It's hard to see how anyone will justify voting against Coburn's amendment, so the forces of reaction are reported to be fighting to keep it from coming to a vote.

If there is to be a war, why not let it begin here?  Write your Congressman.
