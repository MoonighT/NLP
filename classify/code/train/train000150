Families interested in getting more value for their dollar are continuing to look to Rockdale County. The county is booming with new developments, but sales of existing homes also are high, up 18 percent in 2004. "We've experienced pretty strong growth in the average home sale price," said Karl R. Kelley Sr., deputy director of the Rockdale County Planning Department. The growth is probably due, in part, to increased home sizes in new developments, he said.
