Former Clayton County school administrator Samuel King, 42, will become the first black superintendent of the Rockdale County school system as of July 1. "This is a man of vision, of great energy, and one who is dedicated to meeting the individual needs of students," school board chairwoman Darlene E. Hotchkiss said. "He told the board there is no reason a system like Rockdale ... should not be nationally recognized. And that is his goal." King replaces departing Superintendent Ruel M. Parker, who retires at the end of June after 34 years in the Rockdale school system. Parker had been superintendent since 1999.
