Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, working in a high-security laboratory, have brought back to life the influenza virus that killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide in 1918. News of the achievement was released Wednesday by the journal Science. Simultaneously, a second journal, Nature, published the complete genetic sequence of the long-lost virus, the product of a 10-year effort by a scientific team in Washington.
