Normally on a Monday evening, Spc. Faith Anderson would be standing behind the counter at Ross Dress for Less in Warner Robins, ringing up discounted fashions for customers. During the day, she'd be hitting the books at Middle Georgia College, where she is just one year shy of a degree in business. But these days, Anderson is spending her days unloading military supply trucks and making sure that everything the 48th Brigade Combat Team needs &mdash; from beans to bullets to bandages &mdash; is distributed properly.
