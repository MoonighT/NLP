Cory Doctorow:
I was completely charmed by this collection of Yiddish postcards from the early 20th century, retreived and scanned from the poster's grandfather's collection:

This web site is devoted to the postcards my grandfather collected from approximately 1906-1918. The collection is comprised of 435 postcards, most of which were produced in Russia, Poland and Germany. My maternal grandfather, Benjamin Swartzberg, lived from 1890 to 1985. For the past five years I have simultaneously been researching the history and origins of my grandfather?s postcard collection as well as the genealogical history of my grandfather?s family. Both aspects of my research have resulted in discoveries about my grandfather and his family which have been immensely gratifying. What follows is an account of my exploration into my grandfather?s life as seen through his postcards and his family history. You will find 36 images of Benny?s postcards here on this web page.
