Ask Jere Wood the most important accomplishment of his seven years as mayor of Roswell, and he'll say the eastside annexation. Not coincidentally, Wood is now leading the effort to annex another piece of unincorporated land on Roswell's eastern flank. The numbers make it clear why he wants to do it and why the previous annexation was so important. If the Newtown area chooses to join Roswell, Wood said, the city should be able to maintain its millage for the next 20 years &mdash; and it already has one of the lowest rates in Fulton County.
