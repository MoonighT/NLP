Five years ago today, 17 U.S. sailors were killed and 39 injured when terrorists in Yemen attacked the USS Cole.

Costelow credits her three sons with keeping her going after the attack and continuing to give her life direction now, she wrote.

&ldquo;There are still times that it is difficult to deal with the pain of watching my boys grow up without a father,&rdquo; Costelow wrote. &ldquo;I know I could have remarried just to give them a father again, but I'd rather do this on my own than to marry for anything other than love.&rdquo;

She wrote she is proud that the chief's mess aboard the Cole was renamed after her husband. Her children love visiting the ship because it helps preserve memories of their father and give them a sense of who they are, she wrote.

"In Aden, the young men rose up for holy war and destroyed a (ship) of injustice," bin Laden said at a celebration of the marriage of his son.
He spoke of the ship as having sailed "to its doom" along a course of "false arrogance, self-conceit and strength."

We didn't start this war, but by God, we're going to finish it.

Remember the dead, the wounded, and the survivors this day. The war began well before 9/11, and finish it we will, lest it finish us.

Too many of us were blind in 2000 -- unable or unwilling or simply too uninterested to connect such blood-stained dots as al Qaeda's 1993 World Trade Center bombing attack, the 1996 Khobar Tower bombings, the 1998 African embassy bombings, and the attack on the Cole. After Sept. 11, 2001, all of our eyes should have been pried wide open to the evils of Muslim extremism that exist among us in both organized and freelance form. 

 The watchdogs in the national press, however, insist on clouding our vision.
