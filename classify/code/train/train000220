A Lilburn man was arrested Saturday night and charged with torching his house during a domestic dispute, authorities said. Sakib Mujkic, 53, of 168 Gaston Court, was being held without bond at the Gwinnett County jail Sunday on a charge of first-degree arson, according to Sheriff's Department records. Mujkic's wife and two children escaped from the house and are staying with friends, said fire spokesman Lt. Craig Stanley.
