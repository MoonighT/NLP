Advertising consultant Robert Wilson dropped out of contention for the Sandy Springs City Council District 5 seat last week, saying he would not be able to spend the long hours required to help create a city government. Three candidates remain in the race for the city's southeast district, which covers most of the area bordered by Atlanta on the south, DeKalb County on the east and Roswell Road on the west. The three remaining candidates are investment manager Tibby DeJulio and lawyers Kevin S. King and Kathleen Womack.
