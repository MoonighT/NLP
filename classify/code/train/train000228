From: 20th Century Fox - Year: 1995-1997 - Rated: Not Rated - Release Date: August 02, 2005 - Features: Extras! *  - Recommended! 20th Century Fox isn't wasting any time in releasing the X-Files Mythology boxed sets.  The third volume, Colonization, hit the streets on September 27.  In similar fashion to the other volumes, The Black Oil includes 15 compelling episodes that rank among the best of each season.  However, it is recommended only for casual fans or devoted completists who must have the new commentaries and documentary. Amazon Compare
