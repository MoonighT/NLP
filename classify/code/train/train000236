Several relatives of victims came to Fulton County Superior Court Monday for a pretrial hearing expecting to see accused courthouse gunman Brian Nichols, but he was a no-show. Judge Hilton Fuller, concerned that Nichols hasn't joined his defense team for hearings since May, summoned Nichols from the county jail to court Friday afternoon for a private conference. "I've had a lengthy conversation with Mr. Nichols about him not appearing in court," the judge told attorneys for both sides Monday during a hearing that was open to the public.
