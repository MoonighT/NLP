Voters in Oregon have twice endorsed a measure that allows physicians &mdash; under very proscribed circumstances &mdash; to provide their terminally ill patients with the drugs they need to take their own lives painlessly. So far it is the only state to have taken such a step. It's not likely that many other states will follow. But unless the U.S. Supreme Court upholds Oregon's right to enact such a law, voters elsewhere will never have the opportunity to even consider it. The high court last week heard a Bush administration appeal seeking to declare the Oregon statute in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act. In this case, the court &mdash; now under the direction of Chief Justice John Roberts &mdash; should declare that the federal government has overstepped its authority. The law allows doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of painkilling medicine to a patient only under strict circumstances: the patient must have six months or fewer to live, must be judged mentally competent by two other physicians and must be able to swallow the dose without assistance. (In this way the Oregon law differs substantially from the 1990s "suicide machine" concept of Dr. Jack Kevorkian.)
