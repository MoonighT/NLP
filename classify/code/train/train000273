A disorderly conduct charge against former Senoia Mayor Dianne Cleveland has been dismissed. Cleveland, 59, was arrested April 6 after acting in a "tumultuous manner" toward Senoia resident Joseph Brogdon. The arrest warrant says Cleveland, a marriage and family therapist who was Senoia mayor from 2002 to 2004, yelled vulgarities at Brogdon.
