A series of football miracles &mdash; the last a rarely called defensive holding penalty on a missed field-goal attempt &mdash; allowed the Falcons to escape with a 34-31 victory Sunday at the Alamodome against a New Orleans Saints team that had Atlanta's number in nearly aspect except bad breaks. After capturing their NFC South opener, there wasn't much celebrating, though. Instead, Falcons players pondered how much longer they can keep winning with a leaky run defense, vulnerable pass coverage and an inconsistent passing game. This performance highlighted holes more teams are beginning to find, players said, and unless a dam is built and fortified, they might not be able to live very long on the good fortune that befell them in this wild affair.
