A randomly picked focus group will meet Monday to talk about the qualities needed in a good schools superintendent, the first such community discussion organized by the Cobb County school board in its search for a new leader. The group consists of 30 people from across the county who were picked from among 130 applicants asking to take part in the discussion. Group members will rank traits they consider key in leadership, forming a list that will be given to school board members at their regular work session Wednesday. Those rankings, district spokesman Jay Dillon said, also will be posted on the system's Web site. The public at large then can pick its own top priorities from among the qualities listed. Those results will be used by board members in the superintendent's search.
