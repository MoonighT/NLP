Neighbors noticed heavy traffic in and out of the ranch-style house outside Stockbridge. They thought the visitors were visiting the family that lived there. But Henry police said the visitors were coming to barter with the homeowner, trading collectible knives, handguns, sabers, samurai swords, computer parts, a four-wheeler and a boat and trailer for methamphetamine. Resident Scott Andrew McIntyre, 35, was charged with felony drug distribution after an early Friday morning raid of his home. He was released later Friday on $15,050 bond.
