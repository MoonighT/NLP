In the immediate aftermath of Katrina's wrath, two almost contradictory reactions have emerged. One is the reaction of most American people and is overwhelmingly positive and constructive. The other -- that of the media and certain politicians -- is negative and destructive. 

We are witnessing in the American people, who are united in a spirit of beneficence, sacrifice and selflessness, a magnificent outpouring of goodwill, untainted and undistracted by issues of blame or self-flagellation.
