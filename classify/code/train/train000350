Cory Doctorow:
Mark Forman is the podcaster who's been serializing my novel Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom read aloud, one chapter at a time, with backing from great, Creative Commons-licensed music. Today he concluded the  reading with chapters nine and ten in one installment. Now he's embarked upon his next project, reading Lessig's magnificent Free Culture.
