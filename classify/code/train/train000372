. . . Al Qaeda's Number Two man Ayman al-Zawahiri disagrees with you. From  of July 9, 2005 to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, to the head (and headsman, as in "decapitator") of Al Qaeda in Iraq:
   
"I want to be the first to congratulate you for what God has blessed you with in terms of fighting in the heart of the Islamic world, which was formerly the field for major battles in Islam's history, and what is now the place for the greatest battle of Islam in this era . . . "
   
Further:
   
"Al Qaeda's ambitions do not stop at Iraq's borders. Establishing the political dominance of Sunni militants in Iraq is only a first step -- a means to an end -- in realizing Al Qaeda's ambitions of imposing its control over the broader Middle East. Under Al Qaeda, Iraq will serve as a terrorist haven and staging ground for attacks against Iraq's neighbors and quite possibly Western nations."
   
Oh, and by the way, no he did not sign his letter "Just kidding."
