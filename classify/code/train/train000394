Friends and family of a Woodstock woman missing for more than a month are hoping a $105,000 reward will bring answers in her disappearance. Sueann Ray, 26, has not been seen or heard from since Aug. 26, said Woodstock police Sgt. Dan King. "Its like she vanished from the face of the earth," King said Saturday.
