The loss of middle linebacker Ed Hartwell for the season to an Achilles tendon injury, set in motion a shift among all outside linebackers. The Falcons hope the change is not too drastic for today's game against the New Orleans Saints. Coach Jim Mora would not confirm the changes, but he would not deny Pro Bowler Keith Brooking likely will replace Hartwell in the middle, Demorrio Williams will assume Brooking's spot on the weak side and rookie Michael Boley would make his first NFL start at strong side linebacker.
