Can reducing the number of mosquitoes and cases of West Nile virus in Fulton County be as simple as properly disposing of discarded tires? A Fulton County neighborhood cleanup research project is trying to find out. In a carefully plotted joint study coordinated by Emory University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, three Atlanta neighborhoods are being tested for "before" and "after" mosquito populations. The Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness and its environmental services "bug guy," Jerry Kerce, who spends his days tracking insects, also are involved.
