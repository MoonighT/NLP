Israeli forces moved swiftly and with determination Sunday to clear families from five more settlements in the Gaza Strip, while protests against the evacuation dwindled along with the number of Jewish civilians in the territory. The army said 20 of the 21 Gaza settlements had been emptied by Sunday night and only 500 of the 8,600 settlers remained. Troops planned today to clear the last settlement, Netzarim, located on the south side of Gaza City, where an estimated 800,000 Palestinians live. That would complete the Gaza evacuation in a week, half the time originally planned. But more resistance was expected at the four West Bank settlements to be cleared.
