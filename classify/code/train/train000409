Shipping rivals DHL Express, FedEx and UPS are vying to expand in China's express delivery market as rocketing global trade with the Asian country drives demand for freight and logistics services. DHL expects China to account for as much as three-quarters of Asia-Pacific revenue in five years, up from more than 45 percent now, a senior executive said Thursday. Asked about China's contribution to Asian revenue, Jerry Hsu, DHL's president for Greater China and Korea, told Reuters: "Hopefully, we will [have] at least 70 to 75 percent five years down the road. We have over 45 percent currently."
