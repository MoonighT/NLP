SCULLY ON MIERS: Everything Matthew Scully says about Harriet Miers conforms to every anecdote I have ever heard privately about her. I'm going to reserve judgment for the hearings, since we are ultimately judging someone's capabilities not her character. But it seems clear to me that Harriet Miers is, by all accounts, a person of deep integrity and acute attention to detail. I'm warming to her. So, I think, should the Democrats. Both sides would do well not to impugn her personally. She is clearly a good and decent human being. That matters too.
