"In Flight" was originally released in 1996, but it doesn't feel dated. No, it feels like a hangover. This first solo outing by former 4 Non Blondes frontwoman Linda Perry, now the go-to producer for the likes of Kelly Osbourne and Christina Aguilera, is thick and morose. Thanks to Perry's behind-the-scenes status, "In Flight" is taking another journey to music stores. Although Perry crafted "Get the Party Started" for punky pop tart Pink, there's no bling or bebopping good times here.
