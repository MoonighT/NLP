 The Raw Feed and AScribe are both reporting that Judy's getting the first of what are sure to be many accolades that prove freedom equals jail time. 

New York Times reporter Judith Miller, who was jailed four months for refusing to reveal the source who disclosed the identity of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame, will speak to participants of the 2005 SPJ Convention &amp; National Journalism Conference at 8:15 a.m. Oct. 18 in Las Vegas.

       Miller, who also will receive a First Amendment Award, will then join a panel discussion titled "The Reporter's Privilege Under Siege." Joining Miller on the panel is Associated Press reporter Josef Hebert, Patricia Hurtado of Newsday, and Bruce Sanford of Baker and Hostetler law firm.
