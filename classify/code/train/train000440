The search is on for a hit-and-run driver who killed a retired Rockdale County probation officer. Morgan County Sheriff and Georgia State Patrol authorities began searching for the driver shortly after the victim's friends discovered the Conyers man's body early Saturday on an embankment off Dixie Highway between Rutledge and Madison. Authorities declined to release the victim's name.
