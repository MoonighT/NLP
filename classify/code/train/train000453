A photog is selling prints of his pix from the Kostnice Ossuary, a church in  the Czech Republic where the bones of 40,000 dead parishoners were dug up and used to line the walls. I've seen this in Portugal, Spain and Italy, too -- it's just amazing and goth as all get out and eyeliner. Chandeliers made of bones, walls lined with skulls and femurs, wow wow wow.

(Thanks, Miss Cellania!)

Update: Here's a panorama of the place, thanks to Adrian.

Update 2: 
Frantisek sez, "'Kostnice' is Czech word for 'Ossuary'. When you wrote 'Kostnice
Ossuary', you basically wrote 'Ossuary Ossuary'. The name of the town
is 'Sedlec'. There are other ossuaries in the Czech Republic, the
Sedlec one being the most famous (several Hollywood movies were shot
here, including Dungeons & Dragons and Van Helsing)."
