The Cobb County district attorney's decision to seek a special grand jury to investigate the ill-fated school laptop program is a rare move for a prosecutor, and a state school official says it is unusual in the education world because it wasn't preceded by an allegation of outright illegality. The special grand jury will determine whether former Cobb schools Superintendent Joseph Redden's administration broke the law when it solicited bids and selected a winner to provide laptop computers to every county teacher and every student from the sixth grade up, a potentially $88 million deal. An independent investigator strongly criticized the process, which ultimately was halted in court, but he did not say anyone had broken the law.
