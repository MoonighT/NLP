Ending his first foreign trip, Pope Benedict XVI urged  1 million World Youth Day participants in an open-air Mass on Sunday to be guided by church doctrine as they exercise their freedom. "Freedom is not simply about enjoying life in total autonomy, but rather about living by the measure of truth and goodness so that we ourselves can become true and good," he said. He urged the young people to follow the teachings of the church. As the search for faith broadens, "religion becomes almost a consumer product. People choose what they like, and some are even able to make a profit from it," Benedict said. "But religion constructed on a 'do-it-yourself' basis cannot ultimately help us."
