The movies biggest flaw is a lack of originality.  While the Mike Ditka angle is a clever one, the rest of the story is a rehashed mixture of iMighty Ducksi meets iThe Big Greeni.  What helped to make those movies work was the spotlight they focused on their talented child cast.  iKicking and Screamingi takes the ball away from the kiddos and gives it to Ferrell.   In return, he spends more time falling down in slow motion than Caviezel did in iThe Passion of the Christi.
