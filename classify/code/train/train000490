Charlie Rice first wore Confederate gray about 134 years after Appomattox, or far too late to do the Lost Cause much good. In fact, Rice was nearly 60 when he took up Civil War re-enacting, a strange and infinitely fascinating hobby. In the past few years, in fact, he's acquired, among other items, two replica, period-precise Civil War-era cannons. Not only does this give him a certain rarefied and aural status during those battle re-enactments he attends, but event coordinators even pay him (minimum $100) to tote his cannons along.
