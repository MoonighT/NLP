The rumor mill keeps churning in Washington about indictments in the CIA leak case. Although no one is sure if or when the special prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, is going to issue indictments, it seems like the White House is already "shaking in their boots" about replacing Rove. Here's an excerpt from today's New York Times:

Given the political ramifications attached to Mr. Fitzgerald's decisions, officials at the White House have begun discussing what would happen if Mr. Rove was indicted.

Among the names being discussed to take some of Mr. Rove's responsibilities should he have to step aside, an outside adviser to the White House said, are Dan Bartlett, currently Mr. Bush's counselor; Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the Republican National Committee; and Robert M. Kimmitt, the deputy Treasury secretary.

"

Bush administration officials are already, obviously speaking with each other about possible indictments&#160;&mdash; after all, if they weren't&#160;&mdash; why would they already be talking about a replacement? And, if the usual "leak free" White House is leaking this information to the New York Times&#160;... maybe things really are falling apart inside??
