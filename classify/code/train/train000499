It's a typical scenario. Student enrolls at a university and gets a university email account. Preferring to use an existing Hotmail or Gmail account, the student has the university account automatically forward to the existing account. The university then proceeds to send a flood of email to the student, everything from parking notices to Bookstore sales to registration information. Inevitably, some students flag this as spam, and the university is flagged as a spammer by ISPs around the world. The typicial IT solution proposed in this article? Block email forwarding and prevent remote access to email, so the student is unable to flag the university as a spammer. The user-centered solution not proposed: stop flooding the student's email inbox with spam. [] [Tags: ] []
