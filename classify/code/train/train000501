Combined Rating: 35% (S:39%; P:33%) - With its plot construction problems and desperately inept lead, the least Ridley Scott could do is deliver on the controversy we were promised when the New York Times began floating the script around to religious experts and historians. Instead the film is even handed to a fault. There is the minor matter of the Vatican's own army portrayed as thuggish glory hounds fighting for riches instead of god, that is a little controversial but it's too weakly played to really resonate in the kind of controvery you remember and talk about after the movie. 
No, in fact there is little to remember or discuss about Kingdom Of Heaven, another mundane excercise in Hollywood spending and marketing.
