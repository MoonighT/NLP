After searching for some attorney somewhere who would agree that secrecy is actually good for taxpayers, the Gwinnett County Commission is apparently considering going back to buying land without the taxpayers having any say. Having agreed last month to suspend all land deals until it researched whether its secrecy violated the law,  the commission found an attorney willing to declare there's no problem in the private deals. But even he said the commissioners have to provide the public with some clues as to what they're up to &mdash; in the form of recording a public vote on contracts in the minutes of their private meetings. (The commission doesn't even do that now. It withholds all information until the deal is closed.) This shallow effort of "researching" the law has been a farce from the beginning. It happened only after  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Gwinnett News staff documented that the commission had purchased $9 million worth of land deals in secret since May. The newspaper reported that few other counties cloak land dealings in such total secrecy, prompting the Gwinnett commission to say it would stop doing so pending further review.
