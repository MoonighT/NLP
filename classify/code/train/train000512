Bars in Sandy Springs would shut down two hours earlier on most nights, and strip clubs would have to stop selling alcohol, under proposed city ordinances reviewed by candidates Saturday. The suggested changes are among the first steps taken by city organizers to clean up the bar scene on Roswell Road as Sandy Springs prepares for cityhood. Nearly all candidates for mayor and City Council attended an unusual, daylong instructional session intended to prepare the first Sandy Springs City Council to hit the ground running on charter day, Dec. 1.
