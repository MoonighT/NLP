The issue in Oregon v. Gonzalez is whether killing patients constitutes an "accepted medical purpose." The issue is not whether the people of Oregon may decide to legalize physician-assisted suicide. They have done so. The federal government is not seeking to overturn Oregon law. The Federal Controlled Substances Act controls the dispersal of dangerous drugs. Regulations under FCTA give the U.S. attorney general power to ensure that such drugs are only prescribed by doctors for "accepted medical purposes." Thus, the question is whether Oregon may permit its doctors to assist suicide with federally controlled drugs.
