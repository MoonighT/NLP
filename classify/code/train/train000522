McKeevers in a terrific, family-run gathering place that is very reminiscent to  " Cheers".  Upon your return, you are bound to see familiar and smiling faces.  They hace happy hour specials, great food, and outstanding service.  They also offer Trivia on Saturday nights, hosted by Liz and a Texas Hold-Em tournament.  They have darts, megatouch, and internet jukebox.  The dining room is spacious and staff friendly and attentive.  We love McKeevers!
