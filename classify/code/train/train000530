When Vivian Malone Jones tried to integrate the University of Alabama in 1963, that prompted Gov. George Wallace's infamous stand in the schoolhouse door.     Mrs. Jones waited out the governor's stand and speech, enrolled in the university and in 1965 became its first black graduate. Her degree was in management.     Thirty-three years later, Mrs. Jones was honored by the state of Alabama with an award named for the governor's wife, the late Gov. Lurleen Wallace. The award recognizes women who have made major improvements in the state.
