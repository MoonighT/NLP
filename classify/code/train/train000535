Iraqi voters return to the polls Saturday to render their verdict on a proposed constitution. If they reject it, whatever hope remains for a tolerable resolution in Iraq would be dashed altogether. It's hard to imagine what course events would take from there, but none of them would be good. Unfortunately, even if the constitution is approved, it would be hard to argue with a straight face that Iraq had reached a turning point of any kind, and that things would now start to get better. The levels of anger, distrust, violence and chaos afflicting Iraq are simply too high to be tamped down by something as fragile and theoretical as a constitution. Certainly, the trends are disturbing. U.S. military officials have admitted to Congress that the number of Iraqi units capable of operating on their own &mdash; a number that will determine when U.S. troops can safely withdraw &mdash; has fallen rather than increased, from just three brigades down to one.
