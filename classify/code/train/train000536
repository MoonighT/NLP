Several readers have written asking us to post the names of the 15 senators who voted in favor of the Coburn amendment.  At Tapscott's Copy Desk Mark Tapscott conveniently broke down vote by yeas and nays in update II to this post.  Here are the Coburn 15, courtesy of Mark: 
 Allard (R-CO), Allen (R-VA), Bayh (D-IN), Burr (R-NC), Coburn (R-OK), Conrad (D-ND), DeMint (R-SC), DeWine (R-OH), Feingold (D-WI), Graham (R-SC), Kyl (R-AZ), Landrieu (D-LA), Sessions (R-AL)Sununu (R-NH), Vitter (R-LA). 
" Polipundit notes that Senator George Allen (R-VA) is the only potential Republican presidential contender on that list.  Reader L.A. Stich also finds it interesting that John McCain did not vote on the amendment.
