The New York Yankees called Braves general manager John Schuerholz last week and received permission to speak with pitching coach Leo Mazzone, according to a person with knowledge of the request. The 57-year-old Mazzone, who has been manager Bobby Cox's pitching coach for the Braves' entire run of 14 consecutive division titles, is not signed beyond this season. Braves coaches all work under one-year contracts, which expire next month. The only difference in Mazzone's situation and that of other Braves coaches is that his salary was already set for next season, if he's back. He didn't return messages left on his voice mail Monday.
