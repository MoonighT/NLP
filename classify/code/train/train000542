John Edwards is having a personality crisis. is reporting that the former North Carolina Senator and VP candidate has joined a Wall Street investment firm where he will do "global deal making." 

Back in North Carolina at UNC-Chapel Hill, Edwards chairs the holier-than-thou . 

Good to see Edwards will be fighting for the little guy on Wall Street. Maybe he can channel some dead people, or get to work on uniting those two Americas he always talks about.
