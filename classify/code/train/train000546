Standing in her on-campus apartment, cooking home-made waffles in her grandmother's waffle iron, 18-year-old Kelly Albertelli doesn't look the part of a typical Kennesaw State University student. Or at least what used to be typical as recently as two or three years ago. In her spacious and fully equipped kitchen, the freshman from Lilburn is making breakfast after walking back from chemistry lab. She lives with three roommates in a four-bedroom apartment where each has her own private bathroom.
