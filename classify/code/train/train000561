Through a fantastic blend of comic acting and innovative computer generated imagery (CGI), award-winning filmmaker Robert M. Young ("Dominick and Eugene," "Caught") has created HUMAN ERROR, a post-industrial, pre-apocalyptic, existential COMEDY based Richard Dresser's award-winning play "Below the Below". New York magazine critic John Simon called its inspiration, "Harold Pinter meets the Marx Brothers."
