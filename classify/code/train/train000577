The Great Georgia Airshow in Peachtree City takes top billing this weekend as the Atlanta area's only opportunity to see amazing feats of flight in 2005. The 8-year-old air show, produced by the Kiwanis Club of Peachtree City and the Dixie Wing of the Commemorative Air Force, is expected to draw record crowds Saturday and Sunday as aviation enthusiasts from across metro Atlanta descend upon Falcon Field. "We always expect 20,000 to 25,000 people," said Jerry Cobb, air show chairman. "But we believe attendance will be higher this year since this is the only event of its kind in the region."
