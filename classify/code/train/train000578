Clayton County sheriff's deputies dug up the Riverdale yard of a suspected drug dealer Wednesday and found 15 pounds of crystal methamphetamine. Acting on a tip, officers for the anti-drug Cobra Unit uncovered two insulated water coolers filled with 14 smaller containers. The containers were packed with crystal meth valued at $100,000, sheriff's spokeswoman Sonna Singleton said. "I've been doing this a long time and I have never found drugs hidden buried in a backyard before," said Lt. Ronald Gardiner. "They are usually stored somewhere convenient so you don't have to dig them up when you want to make a sale."
