TRENTON, N.J. -- In the battle of the millionaires who want to be New Jersey's next governor, Republican businessman Doug Forrester is gaining on Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Corzine in the final weeks before the Nov. 8 election. High property taxes and political sleaze are dominant campaign issues. The winner will pick up the pieces left by Democratic Gov. James McGreevey, who stepped down in November after admitting to a homosexual affair.
