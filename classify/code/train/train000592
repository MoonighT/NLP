The cost of building a library in Tyrone could soar by $300,000 after the Fayette County Commission refused to lift a deed restriction on park land, Councilman Michael Smola said. "It is an extremely sad day for Tyrone," Smola said after the commission voted to keep intact the land use restriction at Shamrock Park in downtown Tyrone. The restriction says if the land is used for nonrecreation purposes, such as a library, ownership reverts to the county. Now, Tyrone might have to buy 2 acres to build the library, and that could cost $300,000, Smola said.
