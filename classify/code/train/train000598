Maybe it's the onset of the annual influenza season; maybe it's "the post-Katrina effect," as some disaster preparedness experts have dubbed it. Whatever the reason, the very real and dire possibility of a worldwide epidemic of avian flu has finally captured the attention of politicians in Washington. Predictably, the issue has become fodder for partisan bickering over whether the nation's lack of preparation will result in Katrina-like chaos if avian flu breaks out in the United States. But sometimes partisanship has its benefits. At the prodding of Democrats, the Senate has managed to shoehorn $3.9 billion into a Pentagon appropriations bill for stockpiling anti-viral medications. And President Bush, to his credit, called a special White House meeting Friday with drug company executives to discuss what it would take to speed up production of a potential vaccine against the bird flu virus. Now that the issue is on Washington's radar, though, much more needs to be done.
