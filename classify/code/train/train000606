CONFESSIONS: The DP already has the "Hung Up" song blasting through the apartment all day and half the night, and if it's any indication of the rest of the album, it's going to be superb. Madonna has always understood pop music in a way that most Americans don't (I exclude gay men). By "pop," I mean popular music that isn't rock, country or hip-hop. So it's unsurprising that the most ecstatic reviews for her new pop-dance album, "Confessions On A Dance Floor," come from the culture that gets pop more than any other: Britain. We have almost a month more to wait?
