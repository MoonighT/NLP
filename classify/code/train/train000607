Every week, Sharpsburg mother Donna Zirlott volunteers for homeroom and chorus duty at Willis Road Elementary School. A member of the PTO, Zirlott is an active supporter of her fifth-grade daughter's campus, even volunteering in a second-grade classroom occasionally. Zirlott hopes to continue her involvement at the middle school being built next door. But if she's not satisfied with new attendance boundaries in Coweta County and her daughter is zoned for another middle school, Zirlott said she just might abandon the public schools. "I would consider private education," she said.
