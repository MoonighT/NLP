Contractors are rounding the bend on the bid deadline for one of the largest projects the state Department of Transportation has ever undertaken. On Friday morning, bids are due to rebuild the interchange between Ga. 316 and I-85 in Gwinnett County, where heavy, crisscrossing traffic has become a safety hazard and a mess. "Right now I assure you as we sit here there are groups of people sitting around town mulling this project," said Steve Parks, executive director of the Georgia Highway Contractors Association.  They are trying to make their bids just a little cheaper, and asking, "Have we missed anything?" he said.
