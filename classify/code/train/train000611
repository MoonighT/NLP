An anonymous reader writes "The Economist and the Guardian both have stories about the release of the Adelphi Charter - an international blueprint for how intellectual property should be made - by Britain's Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce. The Economist says &ldquo;The Adelphi group are a varied crew ranging from Gilberto Gil, the Brazilian culture minister (and pop star) to Sir John Sulston, a Nobel-winning scientist who helped decode the human genome, and James Boyle, a law professor at Duke University. They believe that the intellectual-property system is starting to lean so far in favor of private enrichment that it no longer serves the public interest.&rdquo; The charter calls for evidence-based policy, and a balance between rights protection and the public domain. It also condemns business method and software patents."
