It was only a few years ago that Time Warner shareholders lamented America Online's deteriorating value, enough so that "AOL" was stricken from the company's name and as its ticker symbol. But all of a sudden, the black sheep in the media giant family, which also includes CNN, HBO and the Time Inc. magazine unit, is back in vogue despite continuing subscriber losses that appear to have little chance of dissipating as technology changes. Google Inc. and Comcast Corp. reportedly are in talks to buy a minority stake in AOL for as much as $5 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal.
