The Senate floor came to a crashing halt last week when Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska threatened to resign if the $450 million allocated in the new transportation bill for his pet project -- the so called ?bridges to nowhere? -- was redirected to help with post-Katrina reconstruction.   So much for compassionate conservatism.    

Here?s my question: Why is this considered a threat?  I consider it an offer of the most magnanimous kind.  Stevens is indignant over bridges no one needs -- at the same time his state drip, drip, drips into a crisis caused by global warming.  Satellite data reveal that the area covered by Arctic sea ice hit a record low this September.  Meanwhile, four Alaskan villages are making plans for imminent relocation as the rising sea envelopes the coastline.

Stevens? colleagues should call his bluff and let him quit.  The survival of his state just might depend on it.
