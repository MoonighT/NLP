The Bush administration speaks out of both sides of its mouth when it comes to Amtrak. While publicly claiming to support interstate rail service, the White House has repeatedly tried to starve Amtrak of federal funding and dismantle it piece by piece. That double-talk reached a low point recently amid reports that the Amtrak board had taken an official vote last month that wasn't disclosed for weeks, and then only in an obscure newsletter. The four board members &mdash; all appointed by the president &mdash; quietly decided to divide Amtrak in two, splitting the railway's popular service between Washington and Boston from its long-distance operations in the rest of the country. Under the proposal, Amtrak would continue to own and control its rail cars, tracks, bridges and other equipment along the 456-mile Northeast Corridor, which it now shares with numerous freight and commuter rail lines. However, states and cities outside that corridor that wished to continue Amtrak service would be required to pick up more of the operating and maintenance costs.
