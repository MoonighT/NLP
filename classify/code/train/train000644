The manatee, clinging to a spot on Florida's endangered species list, now is in deep danger of losing its equally important status as Florida's politically sacred sea cow. A coalition of boating and marine development interests has run up such a string of victories &mdash; from easing dock-building permits to altering how the state defines the word "endangered" &mdash; that even Florida wildlife officials are considering whether to roll back regulations intended to protect the slow-moving mammals. "We are changing the dialogue," said lobbyist Wade Hopping, whose push to ease regulations with a 1999 strategy memo argued manatees might no longer be close to the brink of extinction.
