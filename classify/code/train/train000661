Woodstock in Cherokee County is getting a third interchange on I-575, although the exact timetable is uncertain. The Woodstock City Council received a letter from Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Harold Linnenkohl last week saying that state and federal authorities approved a full diamond interchange at Woodstock Parkway, formerly Rope Mill Road. Federal Highway Administration officials earlier had all but dismissed the notion of a new interchange, citing its proximity to existing interchanges and the safety concerns that come from merging traffic. Woodstock Mayor Bill Dewrell said the city continued lobbying for the full diamond interchange even as it spent $480,000 for a proposed $32 million renovation of the Towne Lake Parkway interchange. The new interchange is expected to cost $13 million.
