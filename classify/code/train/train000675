It's going to happen again. The only question is which team it will be. Since Woodstock started playing a varsity schedule in 1998, at least three of the four Cherokee County teams have been in the same region during five of seven seasons. In four out of five of those years, one of the county schools won an unofficial county championship, defeating all the other teams in the county: Sequoyah in 1998 and 2004, Woodstock in 1999 and Cherokee in 2003.
