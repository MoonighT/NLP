Some of the observations near the beginning of this presentation are worth noting, for example, the need for simpler, lower level and more flexible standards ("Web services considered harmful"), or for example, an examination of what the word 'must' means in the context of standards. The rest of the slide show describes a JOSC project to create a standards catalogue. [] [Tags: , ] []
