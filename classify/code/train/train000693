The graves are on a slope where water has rutted the grass and ground, leaving the impression that this is not a place of rest so much as a place about to be washed away. There are five plots for the poor on the side of the hill, and two grave markers. Only one marker (James R. Campbell, May 30, 1966 &mdash; May 2, 1997) is on the proper grave. The other &mdash; farther up the slope, below the crest with the handsome granite and marble headstones of families who paid to bury their dead &mdash; indicates that a man named James Lindsay lies there.
