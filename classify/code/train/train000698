Twenty-seven states have some form of tax and expenditure limitation. But Georgia, with no structural impediments to governmental growth, must rely solely on elected officials to limit government spending. Yet special interests seeking government favors and politicians trying to charm voters lead many people to doubt that elected officials provide an effective buffer against expanding government. Georgia residents' tax burden was 8.7 percent of their income in 1970, but it crept up to 10.2 percent by 1989. The state and local tax burden remained more than 10 percent throughout the 1990s until a modest retrenchment in government spending following the recession of 2001 reduced Georgians' tax burden to 9.8 percent of their income.
