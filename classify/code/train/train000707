Get ready for a whole new Harriet. After a disastrous two weeks, White House officials say they hope to relaunch the nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court by moving from what they call a "biographical phase" to an "accomplishment phase.?
"

What is this?  Elementary School kickball?  Does the White House seriously expect the American public, let alone an already pissed off Senate, let the President call for a ?do-over??  Sorry, but when the President gets out there and says part of the reason he picked Miers for the SCOTUS is because she is an evangelical; when you have one of the biggest wing-nuts in the country say he learned things about her from the White House that he shouldn?t know; and when even Republican commentators are bemoaning the fact that her resume is devoid of experience on the bench and of any scholarly works on Constitutional issues, you don?t get to kick again.

Yet, a do-over that reintroduces Ms. Miers with a focus on her ?accomplishments? might be even sweeter to watch than the first go around.  Yes, she was a very successful private lawyer and headed up the Texas Bar.  And this qualifies her to rule on core matters of our Constitutional rights how?  John Edwards was a very successful lawyer too.  This apparently was a weakness, according to the GOP, when the issue of him as Vice President came up.  Yet, it?s good enough to put someone on the highest court?  Does the GOP wanting to focus on Ms. Miers ?accomplishments? mean any person who has ever headed a Bar Association is now qualified to serve on the Supreme Court?

This nomination is a ship in some stormy seas, and the crew is running around like a chicken with its head cut off.  In fact, with Karl Rove distracted, the entire White House operation has become Romper Room.  Hmmm?. Maybe that explains this call for a ?do over.?
