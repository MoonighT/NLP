According to a University of Pittsburgh study presented at the 47th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology, Oct. 16 to 20, gene therapy could be used as an agent to protect normal tissues from damage during a second administration of radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.  Administration of manganese superoxide dismutase plasmid liposome (MnSOD-PL) gene therapy prevented the damaging radiation effects in mice, even when the radiation was re-administered after six months.
