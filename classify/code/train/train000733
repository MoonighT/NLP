I have to express my strong objections to the Register&#146;s Oct. 9 editorial, "Spare Us More Embarrassment: Replace King." First, whose embarrassment are you talking about? Surely not that of the majority of the citizens of Iowa and, in particular, those of the 5th District.

If the Register would take the time to determine the facts it would find that a vast majority of the citizens of this state and this country do not subscribe to the politically correct mind-set of the mainstream media and the far-left liberals.

The truth is that there were a vast number of card-carrying communists/socialists exercising their influence to the detriment of the United States up to and including in the 1950s.

Perhaps the most ridiculous justification for your editorial&#146;s thesis was Congressman Steve King&#146;s objection to the naming of a U.S. post office for a largely unknown left-wing activist. Was the fact that she is a 94-year-old woman and suffering from Alzheimer&#146;s disease the justification for your outrage? Surely you would not advocate that every left-leaning person who has served on a city council should have something in the public domain named after them.
