A man who was allegedly stalking his ex-girlfriend was shot and killed by the woman's new boyfriend after he confronted the pair at a Fulton County apartment, police said. Fulton County police spokesman Gary Syblis said the 35-year-old ex-boyfriend, who was not identified, approached the man and the woman as they were arriving home after midnight Friday at the Stratford Apartments on Glenridge Drive. The former boyfriend pulled out a gun, prompting the current boyfriend to draw his own gun and shoot him in the head, Syblis said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.
