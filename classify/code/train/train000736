On Wednesday, AFSCME and a diverse group of progressive organizations launched a national campaign to send the message to the President and Congress that it's time to put America's families first.  

The Emergency Campaign for America's Priorities (ECAP) is a national effort to fight the Republican Congressional Leadership's attempt to make destructive cuts to vital public service programs and give new tax breaks to the wealthy.  

The campaign comes on the heels of a vote in Congress that is expected later this month on at least $35 billion in proposed cuts to programs such as federal student loans, Medicaid and food stamps.  Meanwhile, the Republican Leadership is pushing for another $70 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy.  Not to mention the $50 billion they just approved to continue funding the war in Iraq.  

In wake of this fiscally and socially irresponsible agenda, AFSCME and other progressive organizations are hosting an "Online March" for a federal budget that prioritizes working families and common sense.

Online marchers are able to post their own march sign to an interactive map of the United States.  On October 18, the messages of all the marchers will be sent to President Bush and Congress telling them to: Get Your Priorities Straight!

As stated by AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee:

[It's time] to stop gutting programs that benefit the poor and middle class while giving another boon to the wealthy.
