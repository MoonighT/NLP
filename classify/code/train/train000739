Bob Johnson swished his red wine around a glass at Watershed, musing about the Decatur vibe. The Indigo Girls bought an old garage on Ponce de Leon Avenue and turned it into an upscale restaurant. The aluminum garage doors had been replaced with glass. On pleasant evenings, the restaurant rolls them up to the ceiling. Johnson was more interested in the wine list.
