A detailed look at the Cherokee County SAT information from 2005 shows that college-bound seniors are most interested in nearby Kennesaw State University, and the scores show that traditional achievement gaps between races remain. Seniors taking the test get to choose which schools will get their results, a strong indicator of where they will apply. Kennesaw State got scores from 63 percent of the seniors taking the test. The University of Georgia was second, with 51 percent, according to the College Board District Highlights Report. The closer look at the figures comes a few weeks after the board released the overall results. KSU officials reported 188 freshmen from Cherokee County this school year in the 4,590 freshman class. Overall, 274 Cherokee high school graduates, most from Etowah High, attend the 18,500-student school.
