The Coweta County Development Authority is hoping to announce by the end of next month the location of two major industrial facilities in the county. "We have been working hard on these projects, and we believe we will see both of them locate in Coweta," said executive director Bill Harrison. One client, in negotiations with the county since last year, is considering developing a 1 million-square-foot distribution center in Creekside Industrial Park at Walt Sanders Memorial Boulevard, Harrison said.
