From generals to privates, soldiers pledged to never forget Sgt. Chad Mercer as a memorial service was held Tuesday honoring the first member of the 48th Brigade Combat Team killed in Iraq. At a solemn sunset ceremony, the 25-year-old from Waycross was remembered as a consummate soldier, teacher, competitor and family man. "God gave us Chad, and his presence made each of us a better person," said Lt. Col. Harry McCorkle, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment. "His soldiers respected him because of who he was. They wanted to be like him. His spirit will always be with us."
