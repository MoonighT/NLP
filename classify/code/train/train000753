Seeking to reassure conservatives furious over his choice for the Supreme Court, President Bush defended Harriet Miers on Tuesday, saying she would be a strict constructionist who would not legislate from the bench. "I know her character, I know her strength, I know her talent, and I know she's going to be a fine judge," Bush said at a Rose Garden news conference. Bush has asked his conservative supporters to trust him in making the unpopular choice to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement plans earlier this year and is often a critical swing vote on the high court. But many social conservatives continued to heap scorn on Miers' nomination, saying her selection shows that Bush ignores their agenda except at election time.
