The newest member of the Canton Police Department has a soft, furry coat. Farro, an 18-month-old German shepherd, joined the department last month as the city's first police dog. Jeff Lance, Canton's assistant police chief, said Farro is trained for three jobs: patrol, tracking and sniffing for drugs. The addition of the animal will improve safety for the other officers.
