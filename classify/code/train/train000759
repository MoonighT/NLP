Interesting and useful guide providing background and contacts for members of the media covering issues related to the privatization of components of the educational system, including charter schools, vouchers, private management of schools (such as Edison), and commercial supplementary services. The picture the booklet presents is one of mixed to dubious success - the introduction of charter schools in Dayton, Ohio, for example, is reported to have offered no improvement in grades, and also to have hurt educational outcomes in the public school system as well. But that said, the authors caution repeatedly that care must be taken when interpreting measurements of educational outcomes. PDF. [] [Tags: , , , ] []
