School districts across the state are trying to cut fuel costs by canceling field trips. However, teachers and administrators who are committed to broadening their students' learning experiences through arts and cultural programs need not despair of opportunities to do so, even though transportation costs may prevent off-campus excursions. Organizations such as Young Audiences, Woodruff Arts Center enable schools to maximize field trip dollars by eliminating transportation costs altogether. The mission of Young Audiences, Woodruff Arts Center is to improve the education and lives of children through the arts. We do that by developing curriculum-based programs with professional teaching artists and making those programs available in schools across Georgia.
