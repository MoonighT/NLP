When Brenda and Billy Landers decided to buy a franchise, they contacted a franchise consultant to help them narrow their search. "They profiled us and said our best bets were a coffee house or an oil-change place," Brenda Landers said. "I thought, 'There's no way I can change oil,' but a coffee house, that seemed to fit." And thus, the first It's A Grind franchise in Georgia was born. With help from daughter and co-owner Belinda Landers, the coffee shop opened on Sept. 5.
