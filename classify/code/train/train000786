Sandy Springs residents have several chances this month to learn about plans for the new city and to hear from the candidates who want to serve as its first leaders. The Governor's Commission on Sandy Springs, the interim committee serving until the first government takes over, will hold a public information meeting this week to talk about plans for the new city. A panel of people involved in the transition effort, including representatives from the commission, the volunteer citizens task forces and CH2M Hill, the company recommended to provide city services, will take questions from the audience. On Oct. 19, the League of Women Voters and the Sandy Springs Civic Roundtable will host a candidate forum at North Springs High School. The forum will be in a question-and-answer format. City council candidates for districts 1, 4, and 6 will be on stage first, followed by mayoral candidates, and then by council candidates for districts 2, 3, and 5.
