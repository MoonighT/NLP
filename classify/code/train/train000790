Hey folks!

I wanted to check in to extend a HUGE heartfelt thanks to the world famous Foo Fighters, who are currently on tour around the US.  For those who don't know, the Foo Fighters are deeply committed to raising the level of citizen participation in politics&#151;so much so, that DFA and Campus Progress are sharing a sign-up booth at all of the Foo Fighters' performance venues to help get concert-goers involved in taking our country back.  We've been at over 15 concerts so far and have had great success.

Two nights ago, my family and I had a chance to catch up with them in Bridgeport, CT.  The show was fantastic!  Awesome music, lots of people checking out the booth, and my kids didn't even get lost.  We had a chance to spend some time with the group's guitarist Chris Shiflett.  He's a great guy who speaks passionately about the importance of getting involved in the political process for the future of our country and our children.  

All of us at DFA are very grateful that Chris and his colleagues are putting it on the line for political activism.  A big firstto the Foo Fighters AND to GenDFA and Campus Progress for volunteering at the booth.   Be sure to catch their show and stop by the booth while you're there!
