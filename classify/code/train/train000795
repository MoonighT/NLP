Ruel Parker never intended to be a teacher. He entered college with plans of becoming a physics major but realized he wasn't as well-prepared for the field as he'd thought. "Then I found education," Parker said last week with a smile in his voice. "I fell in love with it and got my degree in science education. The rest, as they say, is history." It's been a full history since then &mdash; one that started with a simple college campus interview and ends this month when Parker retires from his position as Rockdale County school superintendent. Parker has served as superintendent since 1999 and has been with the Rockdale school system for 34 years.
