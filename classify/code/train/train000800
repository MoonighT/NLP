A group of developers wants to build a luxury hotel, condominium and conference center complex that would rise 25 stories, making it by far the tallest building on Atlanta's Southside. Though small compared with the Bank of America building &mdash; at 55 stories the tallest structure in metro Atlanta &mdash; the hotel-condo complex would tower over the rest of Stockbridge.
