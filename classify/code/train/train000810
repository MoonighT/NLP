EMAIL OF THE DAY: "I'm a straight guy who is rather left-wing, and loves the recent convergence between independent conservatives and kossacks on topical issues such as torture, Miers, fiscal sanity, pork, and gay marriage. Both sides can use the dose of the other.

I live with a buddy and I'll be the happiest drunk in the crowd when he marries his long-term boyfriend. Tonight I was out for Friday drinks with 4 beautiful girls (2 couples) and only laughed at my "minority" status, loving the open frankness of discussion.

While I understand the "creativity" concerns to an extent, progressives (and their allies) know better. Spontaneity, inspiration, shared, lasting values - the key factors in generating "culture" do not require oppression.  The flourishing, mainstream introduction of my (youngish) friends' perspective is as wonderful as it is radical.  The end of gay culture?  Hardly. Cultures can develop as well in the open as in secret. So long as truth is at its root."
