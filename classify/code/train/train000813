The scenes within the mine have the most impact. With the exception of one forceful incident, the men dont physically harm the women. But the scary abuse they create through comments and vulgarities are disarming, and INorth CountryI paints an honest picture of how words can be used as weapons. It is within these frames that the movie succeedsand then theres the rest of it.
