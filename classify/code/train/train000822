A Sequoyah High School senior is one of 52 Georgia high school students chosen to serve on the Superintendent's Student Advisory Council. James Bradley Stephens will serve as a liaison between students and the Georgia Department of Education. "I am looking forward to our first meeting," said Superintendent of Schools Kathy Cox. "This is a diverse group that represents a good cross-section of students from across the state. Each student brings a unique perspective to the council." The 52 council members will meet with the superintendent four times during this school year to discuss how decisions made at the state level are affecting students in Georgia's schools. The first meeting is Monday at Georgia College & State University in Milledgeville.
