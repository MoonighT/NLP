After the devil went down to Georgia, it seems, he got censored in suburban Washington. In preparation for a guest appearance at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta, the marching band at Hylton High School in Prince William County, Va., had a logical and seemingly innocuous idea: play a Georgia-themed song. They decided on "The Devil Went Down to Georgia," by the Charlie Daniels Band. But early this month, a local newspaper, the Potomac News, published a letter by a resident who, after having seen Hylton's Bulldawg Marching Band perform the country-western hit at a football game, wondered how a song about the devil could be played at school events because of the separation of church and state.
