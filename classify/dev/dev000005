When Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast more than a month ago, it exposed egregious planning failures within the federal agency that's specifically charged with responding to natural disasters. Despite some progress since then, there are still troubling signs that relief efforts intended to provide the most basic human needs are being mismanaged at great cost to storm victims and to American taxpayers. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is providing housing for more than 500,000 Louisiana and Mississippi residents who were displaced by the hurricane. Evacuees, many of them destitute, are being temporarily housed in a hodgepodge of shelters, hotel rooms, private homes, apartments, trailers and luxury cruise ships. But FEMA's post-Katrina housing program has been hindered by an all-too-familiar lack of coordination, and in some cases, a lack of common sense. As a result, the costs of the program are soaring, and families that have been cruelly uprooted by the storm may once again find themselves without a place to live.
