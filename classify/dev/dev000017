Jack Carter, the oldest son of former President Jimmy Carter, is considering a run for the U.S. Senate in Nevada, saying he's grown "disgusted" with the direction in which President Bush and congressional Republicans have taken the country. Carter, 58, said Wednesday that he will conduct a "listening tour" across Nevada during the next few months before deciding whether to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. John Ensign in next year's election. "I'm running basically because I'm disgusted with the way the country is going and this gives me an opportunity to say something," said Carter, who would be the first of the former president's four children to seek public office.
