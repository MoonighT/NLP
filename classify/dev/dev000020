The 2008 presidential election will be the first in which we choose a brand-new president following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The war in Iraq will also be a factor, perhaps a big one.

Those two items will shape the race and make it different from other presidential elections of recent times. Voters will look for candidates who can show an ability to fight terrorism, keep the country safe and show competency in foreign policy. Oh, traditional domestic issues &#8212; jobs, health care and education &#8212; will still be there, but they&#146;ll now have to share the stage with these fresh concerns.
