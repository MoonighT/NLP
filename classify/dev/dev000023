As our redesign process winds down, I'm gearing up to find ways to encourage conservatives to become more involved in the arts.  I've been meeting with a lot of knowledgeable people who have a lot of fantastic ideas, so stay tuned to see what's in store.  If you have your own ideas for what we should do, feel free to post them in the comments area below.

A major part of our expanded arts focus so far is our improved Books &amp; Entertainment section, which I hope you've checked out.  We are continuing to crank out book reviews and have enlisted Megan Basham to review movies for us regularly (check out her Elizabethtown review).  We've also started dabbling in TV, music, and theatre (more to come) and picked up the AP Entertainment wire (coming to the B&amp;E page shortly).

Perhaps most exciting is the addition of the B&amp;E Columns section specifically for columns related to various arts issues.  If you haven't checked out Hollywood screenwriter Craig Titley's article, I'd encourage you to do so.  Megan also has a great piece up that could rekindle your excitement for Elizabethtown if her review doused it.  We've also got writer/director Jason Apuzzo writing for us regularly.

Speaking of Jason, I'm headed out to Hollywood for his Liberty Film Festival next weekend.  Co-founded with his wife (actress/writer Govindini Murty), this conservative film festival is in its second year.  Try to make it to the event, if you can.  If you can't, I'll be writing about it here on the blog and in the B&amp;E columns section, so make sure to check back regularly.
