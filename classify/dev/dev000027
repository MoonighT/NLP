Cobb County's failed plan to give laptop computers to thousands of students and teachers has become the subject of a rare special grand jury investigation. A 25-member jury of Cobb citizens will be empaneled Nov. 4 to consider whether any laws were broken when Cobb school officials awarded the contract, potentially worth more than $88 million to Apple Computer, court officials said. Former Cobb schools Superintendent Joseph Redden, who led the state's second-largest school system for five years before resigning Aug. 24, defended the contract again Friday and denied exerting any undue influence favoring Apple.
