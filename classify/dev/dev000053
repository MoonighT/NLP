A Fulton judge is lobbying officials to rehire a deputy who is accused of lying to cover up missteps on the day of the courthouse killings. Superior Court Judge Thelma Wyatt Cummings Moore sent a letter to Sheriff Myron Freeman urging him to reconsider the firing of Deputy Joel Middlebrooks, who had been assigned to protect Moore's courtroom since 1998. "It is inconceivable to me that anyone would construe anything Deputy Middlebrooks has said or done to be inappropriate," the judge wrote in her letter to the sheriff.
