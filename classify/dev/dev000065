Iraqi leaders remained deadlocked on Sunday over major issues in the country's new constitution, raising the possibly they would fail to meet Monday's deadline and push the country toward a political crisis. With several questions unresolved, Shiite leaders said Sunday that they were considering asking Iraq's National Assembly to approve the document without the agreement of the country's Sunni leaders. Such a move would probably provoke the country's Sunnis, whose participation in Iraq's political process is seen as crucial in the effort to marginalize the Sunni-dominated guerrilla insurgency. Shiite and Kurdish leaders said they were also considering giving themselves more time to reach a deal, though it was by no means certain that they could, without amending Iraq's interim constitution, the law currently in force. That would require a three-fourths majority of Iraq's 275-member National Assembly.
