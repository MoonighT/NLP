Unbelievable. We trusted a complete strangers' recommendation and thank goodness -it was by far the best and most perfect dining experience we have ever had. The entire staff works as a team. Uncovering plates together, making sure there aren't any spots on the glasses. And the food - this place makes you never want to eat "regular" food again.  Everyone should dine like this!
