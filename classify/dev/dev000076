In 1965, Congress created Medicare, a landmark achievement in American history. People needed health care, and the government responded, creating a taxpayer-funded health-insurance program for seniors. It now insures more than 40 million people.

Now we&#146;re witnessing another turning point in the nation&#146;s history: the government&#146;s attempt to dismantle the program. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 didn&#146;t just add a drug benefit. It invited insurance companies to take over Medicare&#146;s functions. Companies can offer seniors insurance for hospital and physician services though Medicare Advantage plans.
