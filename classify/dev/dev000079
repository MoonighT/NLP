With Halloween approaching, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a frightful new energy bill packed with treats for the oil industry and dirty tricks for American consumers facing rising energy bills. The bill approved last Friday would provide taxpayer-funded subsidies to build refineries on public lands that had previously been off-limits to such development. It would also grant exemptions from regulations that require some parts of the country to use "blended" fuels as a way to reduce air pollution. As if that wasn't bad enough, the bill commits taxpayers to help pay legal fees for oil companies if permit applications to build refineries and related facilities result in lawsuits.
