Last week, county water and sewerage authority officials unveiled the Tussahaw Reservoir, a $77 million facility stretching across nearly 1,500 acres, designed to provide drinking water for Henry County for possibly the next 20 years. "This is a historic day for Henry County," said Lindy Farmer, the authority's general manager. "It's been a long time coming."
