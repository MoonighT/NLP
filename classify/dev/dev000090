A fat, balding bespectacled Japanese accountant stole 1.9 billion Yen from his employer to give as gifts to his seventeen mistresses:

Being a favorite didn't mean much to Matsubayashi, though. There were plenty of other fish in the sea. One was a bar hostess he bought an Alfa Romeo sports car for. Another a woman with a liking for kimono who had him foot the 2 million yen bill to refurbish her nightclub. One more stayed at home to look after the 4-year-old child he had fathered. It was a similar story for another woman who continued to receive 800,000 yen a month child support payments for yet another illegitimate child even though they had parted ways. There was even a foreign mistress...

"I want more new women," Shukan Jitsuwa quotes the Cashanova telling the police. "Sex pleases me more than anything else in the whole world. It's what I live for. I don't feel guilty at all."
