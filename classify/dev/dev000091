Randy Cohen - I have an employee with no health insurance -- he opted out of our company plan -- with a wife and children who rely on his income. He has been loyal and productive. I have no bad things to say about him. Recently he was diagnosed with cancer and will not be able to perform his job. Should I continue to pay his salary even after he stops working? How should employers handle such situations? -- Eric Markowitz, Brooklyn, N.Y.
