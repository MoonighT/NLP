Fulton County's constant crowing about its cash reserve has caught the ear of Sandy Springs organizers, who are eager to get their hands on some money. County finance officials estimate Fulton will end 2005 with about $150 million in the bank between its two major operating accounts. Of that, $33 million falls into the special service district, which is used to provide police, parks, planning and other services only in unincorporated Fulton. "It would be good for our taxpayers to have some of their money spent on them," said Gabriel Sterling, one of five negotiators for the new city. "We could use some extra start-up cash."
