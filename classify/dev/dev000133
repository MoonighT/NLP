The service at this renowned restaurant just about ruined our evening!  It was not the fault of the server himself, but rather poor management which overwhelmed the kitchen.  We were seated upstairs with other diners who were dining; that was fine.  We were greeted appropriately, and our order was taken promptly.  Our wine arrived within a few moments, but we were there for over an HOUR before we got our first course!!!!  By the time our entree arrived, we had been there almost 2 hours and were about ready to leave.  We weren't the only ones complaining, another table within earshot was telling the server that they had ordered their appetizer 45 minutes earlier, and where was it???  Apparently, the 2 large wedding groups they had booked downstairs "overwhelmed" the kitchen.  Too bad - but the individual diner shouldn't have to suffer.  My dish (a pumpkin seed crusted halibut) was delicious, but my husband had to send his pork dish away because it was so dry.  The manager "comped" our appetizer and provided desserts "on the house" but by then, we really just wanted to get out of there.
