The narrative surrounding the Lewis Grizzard Museum in his beloved Moreland involves, among others, a best friend, a town mayor, a Coweta County tourism director, some cousins and aunts and a couple of Al Capone's henchmen to boot. Grizzard, a syndicated columnist for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and author of 20 books with titles like "If Love Were Oil, I'd Be About a Quart Low" and "Don't Bend Over in the Garden, Granny, You Know Them 'Taters Got Eyes," died in March 1994 after his third heart surgery. "Lewis is probably up there laughing at us right now," said Dudley Stamps, who was born the same year as Grizzard (1946), grew up with him, caroused with him and was the subject of many Grizzard columns. "If he were here he'd say, 'Forget about this museum. Go out and play golf, or get drunk, or better yet do both.' "
