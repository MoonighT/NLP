Greetings! My name is Laura Quayle and I joined the DFA team in September as a Field-Political Intern.  I started out by helping with the Grassroots All-Star Competition&#151;researching congressional candidates who applied for DFA endorsement.  I've been working on a variety of tasks such as summarizing DFA-Link Meeting reports, performing background research on issues like provisional ballot use, and managing data.  I am also helping to recruit new GenDFA leaders and members online.

I am a senior at Dartmouth College, where I study Political Science. The path that has led me to DFA is a bit less direct than that of most interns and staff members. Over the past several years, I have taught math in the Dominican Republic, worked as a teaching assistant in Barcelona, and interned on an organic farm in France.  I also love baking, making music, learning and performing Mexican folkdances, and being outdoors.

I have always felt strongly about a variety of political issues, such as education, sustainable agriculture and immigration policy, but I didn't get involved with electoral politics as a means to forward my ideals until I volunteered with the Dartmouth Young Democrats during the Kerry Campaign.  I am fairly new to the kind of work DFA does, so I have learned a lot in the past month!

I am not sure what I will be doing after Dartmouth, but I do know that I would like to help make our beautiful world a better place. My internship at DFA is teaching me about one path by which we can seek such positive change.

&#151;Laura
