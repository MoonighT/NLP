They aren't really cities. They don't have mayors, city councils or police departments. But they can levy taxes and put the money to work improving the communities they serve. So far there are 11 of them around metro Atlanta. The 12th may be the most unique yet, but it borrows from the lessons learned by the first. Consider their differences: In the Cumberland Mall area of Cobb County there are gleaming office towers, a convention center and a new performing arts center just getting under construction where I-75, I-285, U.S. 41 and Windy Hill Road converge. In the daytime, the area is very healthy, but at night when the offices and mall close, it loses most of its population and most of its identity.
