Officials will not file charges against the driver of an 18-foot ski boat that struck a cabin cruiser drifting at night on Lake Allatoona June 29, killing two people. The lights of the cabin cruiser weren't working properly and the ski-boat driver could not have seen it, the state Department of Natural Resources investigation concluded. State law requires boats at anchor to have a white light visible from any angle. The light of the cabin cruiser was only partially lighted when it was struck, department spokeswoman Lisa Doty said Thursday.
