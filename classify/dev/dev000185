From: Paramount Home Video - Year: 2002 - Rated: Not Rated - Release Date: October 11, 2005 - Features: Anamorphic * Extras! *  - Recommended! While many animated series hit a wall after just a few seasons, South Park manages to improve as it goes along and continues to maintain a level balance of satire and humor that is difficult to achieve in an animated series.  The Sixth Season boasts several memorable episodes and is a must-have for fans of the series. Highly recommended. Amazon Compare
