With his two daughters at his side, Charles R. Brazil Jr. stood before an audience at Spelman College's Sisters Chapel and wept. His daughters &mdash; Bianca Jade, 10, and Brittney Marie, 6 &mdash; have seen nothing but love, yet he wept for them. He wept for his mother, who had been abused by his father.
