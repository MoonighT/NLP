Fulton County's Personnel Board has upheld the firing of a deputy who prayed with accused killer Brian Nichols just days before the murder suspect allegedly shot dead three people at the courthouse. The board also supported former Fulton Sgt. Jerome Dowdell's termination from the Sheriff's Office for not telling his superiors the specific warning from Nichols' mother &mdash; that she feared her son would get a deputy's gun if he were convicted of raping a former girlfriend. Dowdell had told a lower ranking officer that Nichols, then on trial for rape charges, might "act up" if the jury verdict was against him. Dowdell was among eight deputies fired or retired Aug. 8 because of their performances in relation to the March 11 shootings at the Fulton County Courthouse that left Judge Rowland Barnes, court stenographer Julie Ann Brandau and Sgt. Hoyt Teasley dead.
