Words cannot begin to describe how AMAZING this B&B is.  I recently visited The Eagle Inn for my anniversary.  I could not have picked a better place.  The overall feel is romantic and relaxing.  The jacuzzi tub laced with rose petals was simply gorgeous.  The fresh fruit awaiting us as we sat on our private balcony was the perfect touch.  Everything about the Eagle Inn was the best.  The location is ideal, too ... just steps from State Street and the Pier.  I won't stay at another B&B again!!
