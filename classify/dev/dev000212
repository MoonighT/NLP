Long Beach, Miss. &mdash; To the Rev. Louis Lohan, the fresh paint and new carpet smell like hope. In this hurricane-battered beach town, his displaced Roman Catholic church, two Catholic schools and a Baptist preschool have found a home in a refurbished skating rink. Parishioners, strangers, and Seabees from a nearby naval base built walls, cobbled together carpet scraps into a mosaic-patterned floor, and brought in an altar and piano to turn the rink into a bright sanctuary for the 5,000-member St. Thomas the Apostle Church. There's a hall of 12 classrooms for the 300-plus students from St. Thomas school, and from St. Paul in nearby Pass Christian &mdash; and for the tykes from First Baptist Long Beach's pre-kindergarten.
