Sep 23, 2005: "Mind Hunters" brings to mind crappy serial killer movies that were never really made, such as Donald Kaufman's "The Three" from "Adaptation" and "Death Fears Not the Reaper," on "Family Guy." Why? Because serial killer movies are so overdone that the prevailing joke of the screenwriting business is to write a story about a serial killer.
