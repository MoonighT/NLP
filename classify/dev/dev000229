The 17-year-old driver who authorities say ran a red light during a police chase and killed a passenger of another car was charged on Tuesday with vehicular homicide. Georgia State Patrol Senior Trooper Larry Schnall said Erica J. Wiggins also is charged with serious injury by vehicle and failure to yield. Schnall said Wiggins was at first uncooperative but "once reality set in" became remorseful and consented to giving blood for alcohol and drug testing.
