 Quote: "The movie works because of Nighy and Macdonald. They have a natural charm that Michael Douglas and Annette Bening, with their star power and standing, couldn't match in similar situations. As Lawrence, the tall actor is constantly making himself small, trying to fade into the woodwork. Macdonald gets some improbable, heavy-handed speeches as Gina (who would have been humiliated into silence very quickly in real life)."
