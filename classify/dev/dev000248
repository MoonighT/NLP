    IBM has donated code and documentation to the Eclipse foundation to help organize software development. "The material will form the basis for a proposed open-source project, called Project Beacon, which will be voted on within the coming months, according to IBM. About 15 organizations, including commercial software companies and consulting firms, said they intend to use the software."
