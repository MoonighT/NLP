At a time when online travel agencies are all the rage and airlines are threatened by bankruptcy, Decatur Travel is relieved that it hasn't hit any rough waves. The success, says co-owner Richard Felner, is thanks to the agency's more mature clientele of 50 something and older. "I've had any number of people say I was trying to do this on the Internet and got all frustrated and decided to use a travel agent," said Felner.
