Plywood and spools of wiring still litter the new classrooms, car garages and pre-kindergarten room at a construction site off Lee Street in Jonesboro. But not for long. By January, Clayton County hopes to finish building two schools there that will share the grounds and serve students whose education has followed less traditional paths. The district's career academy will teach advanced classes in vocational and technical specialties, such as automotive diagnostics, construction and child care.
