We have visited here several times in the past few months. They can't seem to get my husbands drink order right. What is so hard about Jim Beam over ice with a water back? I have ordered an Old Fashion, (Friday night drink special) it is made from a mix. Another time I ordered a Margarita, it was also from a mix, you would think a "Mostly Mexican" Restaurant would try to make an above average Margarita. On our last visit I had a Jim Beam and Coke, my husband said I spoiled the Bourbon, sorry dear, it was the best drink I had there. Now the food. The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty, ranch dressing was also served. The salsa & dressing came in squeeze bottles and we were not given a snack plate so we ended up passing bottles around the table. The side dishes were okay but nothing to brag about. As for the main course, it was always outstanding, Mexican or Fish (fried or baked). We would like to see some attention paid to the details. By the way did I mention the view, when making your reservation ask for a table by the window and go at dusk, God made this view for you!  We will go back.
