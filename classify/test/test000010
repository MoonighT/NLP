Sgt. Richard Socia has a knack for working the system. The gregarious nine-year Army veteran proved unusually resourceful at networking to improve his living conditions during the two weeks of combat training in the Mojave Desert. While others slept in noisy, dusty tents with up to 250 others, Socia enjoyed complete privacy in a 5-ton supply truck he converted into a sort of military recreational vehicle.
