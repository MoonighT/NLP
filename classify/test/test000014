A century ago this month, the tiny village of Roswell was busy preparing for its first visit by a sitting president, Theodore Roosevelt. In a whirlwind visit that lasted just a few hours, Roosevelt visited Bulloch Hall, the childhood home of his mother, attended a reception at Roswell Presbyterian Church and gave a speech at a newly built bandstand on Roswell's square. Roosevelt's visit will be commemorated Saturday at Bulloch Hall during an event that spans several decades of Roswell history. The day includes a Civil War encampment with re-enactors portraying Union and Confederate soldiers who fought in and around Roswell in 1864.
