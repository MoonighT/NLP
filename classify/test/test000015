Cherokee County School System officials recently estimated they will need $984.4 million over the next seven years to accommodate a growing student population. Superintendent Frank Petruzielo presented the capital outlay report at a recent school board work session. In the meeting, Petruzielo reminded board members that the current five-year Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax (SPLOST) expires at the end of 2006. If voters renew the one-cent sales tax through 2012, district officials said they could collect about $534.4 million.
