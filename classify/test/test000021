I was looking forward to some really good paella and I was not disappointed! It's a bit different from what I am used to (the recipe I am familiar with uses rice that is thicker in texture) but it was trully enjoyable just the same. The serving size is pretty significant as well (one plate was shared by myself and two other girlfriends). It was a perfect paella-sangria Friday evening!
