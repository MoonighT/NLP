Daniel Wolcott's frequent flyer miles are piling up. The Buford man, who was arrested earlier this week for allegedly stealing a $7 million charter jet and taking friends on a joy ride, apparently did more flying that night than had been thought. Law enforcement officials believe Wolcott slipped out of St. Augustine, Fla., around 3 a.m. and flew to Gwinnett's Briscoe Field &mdash; alone. Once in Gwinnett, Wolcott reportedly called friends, who met him at the airport.
