A second child from Montezuma has died from injuries she suffered in a house fire earlier this month.

 Mychael Enlow, 9, died Saturday at University Hospitals in Iowa City, officials with the Poweshiek County sheriff&#146;s office said. Her sister, Alexis Enlow, 6, died last Thursday.

 A third child, Brittania Easteridge, 17, also was injured in the fire, but was treated at a Grinnell hospital and released.

 The Oct. 10 fire started in an upstairs bedroom, but the cause remains under investigation, the sheriff&#146;s office said.
