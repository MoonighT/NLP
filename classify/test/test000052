Jets and prop planes from DeKalb-Peachtree Airport roar over developer Peter Chang's office in Chamblee, but he would be the last to complain about the inhospitable racket. To him it's the sound of a potential customer base coming in for a landing. Chang is a partner in developing the International Village, a $70 million mixed-use project going up next to the north DeKalb County airfield, Georgia's second-busiest airport. Chang figures that his project will benefit from its close proximity to the airport, known as PDK, which is home to about 300 corporate jets operated by companies such as Royal Oak charcoal, Wachovia Bank and the Southern Co.
