Cecilia Bartoli is a diva who could be trotting the globe singing the world's great operatic mezzo-soprano hits. A little Mozart here, some Rossini there, maybe a bit of Richard Strauss. And to vary the pace of solo recitals, songs by whatever other household-name composers her superstar little heart desires. Her large, adoring audience would snap up the tickets and applaud every finely spun trill.
