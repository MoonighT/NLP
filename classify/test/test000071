(InfoWorld) - Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) has entered into an agreement with Mendocino Software Inc. to resell its RecoveryOne software as part of HP's storage management software lineup, the companies announced Monday at the HP Technology Forum 2005.

Mendocino's RecoveryOne software is designed to keep businesses up and running by continuously backing up data as it moves across a SAN (storage-area network). HP will resell it starting in the first quarter of next year, and will begin to integrate RecoveryOne with other pieces of HP's information lifecycle management (ILM) storage software starting in the second half of next year, an HP spokeswoman said. At that point, RecoveryOne will be available under an HP brand, she said.

RecoveryOne fills a hole in the high end of HP's ILM product lineup, the spokeswoman said. ILM is a collection of software and techniques designed to store and protect data as it moves around a company's network. Most users don't need continuous data protection, but some companies, such as financial services providers, need to account for every piece of data that flows through their systems.

HP has been moving to improve its ILM software lineup, and plans to have more to say in that area next week at the Storage Networking World conference, the spokeswoman said.
