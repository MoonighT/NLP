In every time, and in every place, there are demagogues who ride to power by whipping up the fears and resentments of an anxious populace. Our current Joseph McCarthys are the contentious cranks and nativists who want to drive every illegal immigrant &mdash; especially Mexicans, Hondurans and Guatemalans &mdash; out of the country. U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) would overturn a century of constitutional consensus granting citizenship to all who are born in the United States, regardless of their parents' immigration status. He and his ilk have already pushed through a provision that makes it virtually impossible for states to issue driver's licenses to undocumented workers. And here in Georgia, Republican legislators have proposed a bill that would prohibit illegal immigrants from attending state colleges and universities. Never mind that those who are bright and resourceful enough to complete college would make excellent candidates for citizenship. A ban on college is not really intended to curb illegal immigration, any more than a prohibition against driver's licenses. Those proposals are intended, instead, to whip up the emotions of those Americans frustrated by the demands of an unacculturated underclass and resentful about the pace of demographic change.
