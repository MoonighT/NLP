Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi scored a political triumph Sunday as the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party headed for a landslide win in an election touted as a referendum on his push to privatize Japan's cash-swollen postal system. Early today, public broadcaster NHK projected the LDP had won 296 seats in parliament's 480-seat lawmaking lower house, far more than the 241 needed for a majority and the 249 seats it held when Koizumi dissolved the chamber Aug. 8. Combined with the allied New Komei Party, the LDP-led ruling coalition would have more than 320 seats &mdash; a two-thirds majority that would let it override votes by the upper house, the body that blocked postal restructuring last month.
