Yesterday NRO ran a wonderful appreciation of the film version of "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Thomas Hibbs: "To Kill still kills." His meditation on the film gives great pleasure; I wish only he had added some comments on the relationship between the novel and the film.

As part of its series celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of National Review, NRO has also posted Professor Jeffrey Hart's terrific 1999 review of Norman Podhoretz's memoir Ex-Friends: "Family Man."  Professor Hart's own account of National Review (The Making of the Conservative Mind: National Review and its Times) --  a book that itself must be part memoir -- is forthcoming.
