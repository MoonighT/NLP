DVD Reviews: Disney's "Lilo & Stitch 2" is an unremarkable but inoffensive trifle that likely will play best with undemanding tykes who want to spend more time with engaging animated characters. Conspicuously tamer and schmaltzier than more rambunctious 2002 predecessor, vidpic should nonetheless post brisk sales and rental numbers.
