Defects in immune system cells called T helper cells may lead to diseases characterized by a faulty inflammatory response such as autoimmunity and asthma. Understanding the molecular steps involved in how T helper cells mature may help researchers develop treatments for these diseases. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine have shed light on a key molecular switch in this differentiation.
