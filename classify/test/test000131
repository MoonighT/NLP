 
Twice in a week, the California Governor who said he didn't need anyone else's money has  taking $100K from an industry group on the same day he vetoed a bill on the industry's behalf.  

On Friday October 7th, Arnold vetoed one of the wine industry's top targets this year. SB 455 (Escutia) was opposed by the Wine Institute because it would have strengthened pesticide regulation. On that same October 7th, the Henry Wine Group, a major player in the industry, kicked in $100 K to the Gov's ballot initiative campaign committee, the California Recovery team. Talk about juicing an industry. 

Also on October 7th,  Schwarzenegger . The bill would have ended a taxpayer subsidy of the insurance industry in which government health programs pay the medical costs of car accidents instead of the insurance company of the driver who caused the accident.  Taxpayers cough up $225 million each year to pay the claims that the insurance companies are allowed to duck.  The day of SB 399's veto the bill's leading opponent, the American Insurance Association, sent the gov a $105,000 campaign contribution. 

Schwarzenegger's right wing ballot initiatives in his extra November election  is being financed by the "for sale" sign the Gov's  hung on his signatures and vetoes of legislation.
