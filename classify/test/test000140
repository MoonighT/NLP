The Karl Rove Confidence-o-Meter has taken a hit. Back in 2003, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan huffed, in response to Rove being the source of the CIA leak: "there is simply no truth to that suggestion. And I have spoken with Karl about it."  Then last July, Scott beamed that "Every person who works here at the White House, including Karl Rove, has the confidence of the President." Today, asked about the President's confidence in his senior adviser, Scott McClellan deadpanned, "he's continuing to do his duties."
