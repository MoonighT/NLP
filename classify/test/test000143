Too many Georgia workers are shortchanging themselves and their futures by not participating in retirement savings plans at work. Only about four out of 10 are enrolled in employer-sponsored plans, giving Georgia the third-worst participation rate among the 50 states. With the possibility of Social Security benefits being reduced unless the system's finances are bolstered, Georgians who don't save at work risk a less prosperous old age. Only 42.7 percent of Georgia workers age 21-64 are accumulating retirement benefits through plans offered by employers, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute,  a Washington nonprofit supported by business, labor and pension organizations. Georgia's rate exceeds only those of Florida, Arkansas and Utah. The national average is 48.3 percent. The results are based on information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. Georgia is at the very bottom of the rankings &mdash; at 64.4 percent &mdash; when just public-sector employees are considered. New Jersey is at the top, with an 84.3 percent rate.
