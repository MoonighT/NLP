Piedmont Healthcare is proposing  to build a new hospital in Coweta County that would replace the current Newnan Hospital within five years. The Atlanta-based healthcare institution, owner of Piedmont Hospital in Buckhead and Piedmont Fayette Hospital in Fayetteville, met with Newnan Hospital's board of directors Thursday night to present a proposal that would give Piedmont an equity stake in a new hospital. "This is only the beginning," said Tom Moat, president of Newnan Hospital's 16-member board. "If we agree to move forward with Piedmont, we will try to negotiate everything we can for our community."
