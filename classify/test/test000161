Segue Software and Shunra Software announced the signing of a worldwide integration and reselling agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Shunra will resell SilkPerformer, an enterprise load and performance testing solution from Segue, to complement the capabilities provided by Shunra Virtual Enterprise (Shunra VE), a powerful production network environment emulation solution. This agreement builds on the relationship already established between the two companies as a result of integration previously developed between SilkPerformer and Shunra VE. Through the technical integration, SilkPerformer load tests can be automatically initiated and run from within the Shunra VE console.
