    The Big Faceless PDF Library project has released version 2.6.1 with major feature enhancements. "The library is now able to pre-flight PDFs to the PDF/X standard and includes the ability to create, verify, and repair (if possible) documents to the PDF/X-1a:2001 and 2003 standards commonly used in North America, and the PDF/X-3:2002 and 2003 standards more commonly used in Europe. Support for Acrobat 6.x document compression was added along with minor fixes."
