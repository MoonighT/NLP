This item actually came out before the merger but gives us an idea of what to expect. The U.S.-based Copyright Clearance Center is launching a program to link its services with the Blackboard course management system. As Eduventures's  Cathy Burdt comments, "By providing a utility that is integrated, you?re taking the guesswork away somewhat. That?s a net gain for publishers who want to protect their copyrights, professors who want to use a wide variety of works, and universities that are trying to build business processes to manage tasks such as these." The future of Blackboard will be closely tied to the future of commercial content, as publishers will finally have the sole-source point of purchase they've been wanting for a long time. Via .
