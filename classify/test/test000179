A registered sex offender who served more than a year in prison for statutory rape and child molestation faces similar charges after being arrested Saturday in Henry County. Police arrested Michael Lee Peck, 21, of McDonough, on charges of statutory rape, aggravated sexual battery, sexual battery, child molestation and sodomy. Henry County police Lt. Jason Bolton said the allegations involve two 13-year-old girls Peck reportedly picked up from Monroe and took to a home in Stockbridge where the alleged crimes took place. According to the Georgia Department of Corrections, Peck was convicted Oct. 15, 2002, in Henry County and sentenced to two years for statutory rape and child molestation. He has been a registered sex offender since his release from prison in July 2004.
