Saint Condi: Judy Miller and exec editor Bill at the New York Times are getting zapped, with cause, but isn't it curious that the media -- ever as credulous as Miller and Keller -- is busy fashioning a halo for Condi Rice? Talk shows boost her as a presidential candidate for 2008  (and see Dick Morris book Condi. v. Hillary), but this is the woman beside whom Judy Miller looks like Joan of Arc. As  National Security Adviser Condi kept terrorising us with Saddam's bomb - "we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud"  (CNN Sept 8, 2002) - when she knew there was expert testimony that the celebrated aluminium tubes were not at all for centrifuges for a nuclear program. The Times pre-war, pre-Keller, was a culpable part of the White House war propaganda recycling factory, but the  fullest documented expose of the administration's  deceits and vast carelessness appeared where? In Keller's Sunday edition of October 3, 2004. So give Keller a break. 

    As for Condi boosters, they  should be forced to eat  all 10,000 words of the Times piece and for dessert her testimony  to the 9/11 Commission on why she did nothing about the warning of sleeper cells inside the U.S. - "there was no recommendation of anything that needs to be done" - and why she yawned and did nothing following  CIA briefing of August 2, 2001, headed "Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States." She characterised it as "historical information based on old reporting." The past is prologue.
