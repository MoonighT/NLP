Oct 07, 2005:  As a child, I was more frightened of my parents than movie monsters, because movie monsters couldn't really hurt me, but my parents could ground me from watching TV. So the gory stuff never did it for me and still doesn't. You might get a leap out of me with the tired cat-jumps-in-the-window scene, but nothing that leaves me good and scared. What's really scary are the awful things people can do to other people. This is what makes 1988's "The Lady in White" a really good, really creepy film.
