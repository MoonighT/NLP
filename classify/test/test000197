Mary Ellen Dreier&#146;s outgoing voice-mail message tells you she&#146;ll get back to you &#8212; "In the meantime, may God bless your day."
Dreier, of Cedar Falls, became an Evangelical Christian in her 50s after what she calls a "Pentecostal experience." Raised in a mainline Methodist church, she&#146;d flirted with atheism in college, then reconnected with religion through her Baptist husband. That helped replace the "lost feeling" she&#146;d been having. But what really changed her life was attending a "charismatic renewal" meeting where a witness spoke in tongues.
