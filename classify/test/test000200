That old microwave, stereo equipment, computer or cell phone in your garage can be discarded properly with ease on Saturday. The county and 5R Processors Ltd. will hold a "Free Electronic Drop-Off Day" from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at two locations: DeKalb County Government Office Park, 4380 Memorial Drive, Decatur, GA 30032, and Brook Run Park, 4770 North Peachtree Road, Dunwoody, GA 30338. The county bills this as a chance for businesses and residents "to reduce the environmental liability for all hazardous materials contained in electronic equipment."
