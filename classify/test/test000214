Fulton County leaders appear ready to pull the plug on the tax district once hailed as the way to redevelop Sandy Springs' dilapidated central business district. County attorneys and lawyers for the state Legislature have concluded that Fulton County cannot run a tax allocation district, or TAD, inside a city and that the one in Sandy Springs must be dissolved. The Sandy Springs TAD was created in 2003 to collect an expected $25 million to fund redevelopment efforts along Roswell Road from the Atlanta city limits north to Trowbridge Road.
