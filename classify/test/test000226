A NASA study is offering new insight into how the Earth's water cycle might be influenced by global change. In recent years, scientists have warned that the water cycle may be affected by temperature changes, as warmer temperatures can increase the moisture-holding capacity of air. The global water cycle involves the transfer of water molecules between the Earth's land masses, cryosphere, oceans and atmosphere... click link for more info.
