Here's a quote from White House Press Secretary, Scott McClellan from just a couple of days ago: 

'"[W]hen you're engaged in a war, it's not always pleasant, and it's certainly a last resort. But when you engage in a war, you take the fight to the enemy, you go on the offense. And that's exactly what we're doing."

How does this make any sense? Every time I see a quote like this, I get embarrassed for the Democrats. How did they lose to these guys? How are they not able to pick apart this terrible logic, or lack of logic?

If Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks against us on September 11th -- as the 9/11 Commission concluded and the White House admitted -- then how is starting an offensive war against them, a war of last resort? 

They never say that Afghanistan was a preemptive strike or a first strike because Afghanistan was sheltering al-Qaeda, who did attack us. The very definition of preemptive indicates the other side has not struck yet. Iraq had not attacked us by the administration?s own definition. So, there were plenty of other choices rather than launching an invasion of a country that did not attack us.

Furthermore, we seem to have forgotten that preemptive means to preempt. Does anyone in their right mind believe Iraq was about to launch an attack on us? In order to launch an attack, you need something to launch. They didn't have nuclear weapons, they didn't have the submarines and drone planes the White House comically claimed to be worried about -- they didn't even have a single weapon of mass destruction. 

You have to be nuts or completely disingenuous to believe that Iraq was about to launch an invasion of the United States. If you agree that Iraq was not about to attack, then the Iraq War cannot be called a preemptive war. It certainly cannot be called a war of last resort. The one thing they do have right is that it can be called an offensive war. That also has another name -- a war of aggression.

Is that what we do these days? I remember other countries in history going "on the offense." I remember other nations starting wars of aggression. I don't want to be one of those countries. Do you?
