Documentary on the life and work of Evelyn Glennie, who grew deaf as a child and as an adult is a musician using percussive instruments, which she experiences using her body as a ?resounding chamber.? Scenes set all over the world, as she performs both formally and by improvising with found objects; we also see her recording a CD with musician Fred Frith. Her music takes on an eerie quality through the ways of its making; it must feel right to her, and when it does it sounds slightly uncanny to us, as if appealing to senses we are were not aware we possessed. Inexplicably, the film is not subtitled, despite its obvious appeal for the hearing-impaired.
