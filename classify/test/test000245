A federal court has ordered the DeKalb County school district to stop using a program created to help minority professionals, such as architects, engineers and lawyers, get contracts. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declared DeKalb's Minority Vender Participation Program unconstitutional in June. Last week, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia issued a permanent injunction. Lee Parks, a lawyer who represented a Marietta architect in an eight-year court battle, said the decision will stop low bidders from being passed over in favor of higher bids from minority-owned businesses.
