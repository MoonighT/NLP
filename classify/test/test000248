Lillian Webb, one of the most enduring politicians Gwinnett has ever known, is vying for her 12th term as mayor of Norcross, a city that bears little resemblance to the town she first led in 1974. The 77-year-old mayor, who's served 32 years in elected office, could be facing her most serious challenge in a decade. Her challenger is former City Councilman Craig Newton, who made history 10 years ago when he became Norcross' first African-American councilman. Newton hopes to break the same barrier by becoming mayor.
