On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration laid out an important proposal to strengthen our nation's BSE firewalls. Since bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) was first identified in the United Kingdom, the United States has responded to developments both outside and inside the United States with policies that carefully consider the risks presented and the additional protections that can be achieved for both animal and human health. The Food and Drug Administration is proposing to ban from the feed supply certain higher-risk cattle materials. Together with restrictions already in place that prohibit the feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants, this latest proposal would ensure that the United States maintains its position as a low-risk nation for BSE and a leader embracing scientifically sound policy. For consumers, this should be more good news. Under a now-16-month-old enhanced cattle surveillance program designed to detect BSE if it exists in the U.S. herd, only one case has been detected. That brings to two the total number of U.S. BSE cases in a nation with a 100-million- head herd &mdash; one of the world's largest.
