William F. Buckley - The Supreme Court gave visitors a chance to ogle in action the new chief justice. The arguments being heard had to do with Oregon's assisted-suicide law. The law was established by referendum in 1997. In an earlier referendum voters had marginally approved the practice; the second time they did so overwhelmingly (60-40). But the federal government, after observing the law's itinerary in lesser courts, intervened. It said to Oregon: "You can't do that! We feds passed 35 years ago the Controlled Substances Act, and that means that only we, the feds, can authorize what your assisted-suicide law would permit."
