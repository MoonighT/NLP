Theres plenty to nitpick about here. One could argue that the Sisters are stereotypes who wouldnt come near each other in real life, or that Greece cant look like its been gone over with Soft Scrub so that even the dirty old men eyeballing Lena look clean. Do the women really have to be straight out of My Big Fat Greek Whatever, spouting home-baked philosophy and emoting hysterically?
