Aislinn Kindle is a wife and a mom. She hasn't been in a classroom for seven years. But here she is, squirreled away on a gorgeous late summer day in a drab white room, pondering an equation scrawled on the whiteboard in front of her: f(t)=cos(2(((pi symbol)))*262*t) Eech. Sounds . . . mathy. But Kindle isn't a math student, at least not directly.
