Southern states, including Georgia, often style themselves as the last bastions of traditional family values that other parts of the country abandoned long ago. Supposedly, this is still the kind of place where Mom, Dad and the kids traipse to church on Sunday and then show up at Grandmom's for chicken dinner. Unfortunately, the reality's a little different. According to a new U.S. Census Bureau report &mdash; the first to offer a state-by-state look at links between marriage, fertility and other characteristics &mdash; the South leads the nation in unwed births. In Georgia, nearly four in 10 babies are now born out of wedlock, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis of state birth records. That reflects a trend that shows no sign of abatement. The newspaper review found that in 1980, single mothers accounted for 22 percent of births in Georgia. A decade later, the percentage increased to almost a third of births.
