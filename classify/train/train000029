Rescue operations wind down in Pakistan as the government raises the official death toll from the Oct. 8 quake to 38,000. Another 60,000 are listed as injured. The focus now is getting aid to the living, especially those in remote mountain villages, say officials. The United Nations estimates more than a million people are now homeless.
