When colleagues cleaned Meg Smith's kindergarten classroom at the end of the year, they filled more than a dozen 18-gallon tubs with books, toys and other items the Peachtree City teacher couldn't work without. Now those supplies await Smith's return from an Atlanta hospital, where she has been undergoing aggressive treatment for cancer and recovering from the delivery of Benjamin, her firstborn. Since Smith, 28, was diagnosed with cancer this spring in the middle of her pregnancy, co-workers, students, parents, friends and neighbors have rallied around her, sending cards, saying prayers and conducting fund-raisers. In a little more than a month, they have raised about $50,000 with a walk-a-thon at Smith's school, Crabapple Lane Elementary, and with a golf tournament, raffle and barbecue.
