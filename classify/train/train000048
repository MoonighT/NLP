When I think of Constance Baker Motley, I think of pay phones, the old-fashioned pay phones that took only coins for calls, local or long distance. Every courthouse had one. That was important to her. She was often representing clients in courthouses that stood square in the center of a Jim Crow zone. No black lawyers had offices nearby; no white lawyers who did were likely to offer her use of their office. She might have to walk for blocks before crossing an invisible line, on the other side of which she could walk up to a counter and order a glass of iced tea. I think of the rest, too. I think of her standing by James Meredith's side, or Medgar Evers', or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s. I remember that she was "Connie" to Thurgood Marshall &mdash; who as legal director for the NAACP sent her, a very young attorney, to the Deep South to handle litigation as intense as any the world has known. He sent her because a black woman was safer than any man.
