Angela Merkel's party narrowly won Sunday's parliamentary elections, but the close, fragmented vote left the chancellor's office in doubt, and could lead to a weak government for the world's third-biggest economy. Official results released early today showed that Merkel's Christian Democratic Party had barely edged out Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democratic Party, with smaller parties splitting nearly a third of the vote. Because of the complicated process of assembling a ruling coalition, it was not certain that Merkel could become Germany's first female leader. Even with slightly fewer votes, Schroeder's party could end up with a small advantage in seats won, giving him the lead in forming a government and winning a third term as chancellor.
