Police searched for bodies in a dark, rat-infested subway tunnel and intensified their investigation Friday into the London terrorist bombings that killed at least 50 people, focusing on the possible involvement of Islamic extremists. But devoid of the early leads that helped solve the commuter rail bombings in Madrid, Spain, in March 2004, the inquiry promises to be extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming. Meanwhile, in a display of grit, Londoners from commoners to the queen promised to thwart the terrorists by returning at once to life as usual.
