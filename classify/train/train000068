Joss Whedon understands something George Lucas never will.  Its not the Jedi that got us interested in Star Wars, its Han Solo.  Hes used that knowledge to craft ISerenityI, a rip-roaring and sometimes moving space adventure that picks up almost where the crew of the Millennium Falcon left off, except this time without any of those pesky, holier-than-thou Jedi around.  Lightsabers or no, were all better off.
