Baghdad, Iraq &shy;&mdash; The baby-blue metal gate stays closed most of the time. The world outside is a vastly different place. The gate separates the bustling streets of Keradah, one of Baghdad's livelier neighborhoods, from the oasis of St. Hannah Church and Orphanage, where large balconies overlook a lush green lawn and a flower garden of roses and lilies. Inside the small, simple Chaldean Catholic church, wooden pews offer serenity to anyone who wants to come in and say a prayer. Beyond the gate lies a menacing city, where streets can turn treacherous in an instant, forever changing lives.
