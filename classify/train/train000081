I have lived in the Middletown area for almost twenty years. I was the chef at the president's house at Wesleyan University after moving from NYC. I know food. I love food. It's only natural has been a consistent clasic for me all that time.My absolute favorite thing to do is to pop in at cocktail hour and order a steaming, hot plate of sweet potato fries. They are crispy on the outside and moist in the middle with a fabulous crusty coating of salty herbs that doesn't overpower the sweet/briny flavor. But they are never greasy! Besides this the baked goods are always fresh and full flovored, the soups are heady and satisfying and my all time favorite the macro platter gives you a virtuous, healthy feeling after consumption without sacrificing taste. On top of all this every plate is artistcally and carefully prestented to please the eye as well as the pallette. I'll keep going as long as they do.
