Under a tight deadline to find a site for its new library, Tyrone might have to buy land, which could hurt its fledgling soccer program. Town Manager Barry Amos said Tyrone has less than 45 days to find land for the library so it doesn't risk losing a $1.27 million state grant. Construction is supposed to begin early next year and take 15 to 16 months. If the town has to buy land, it might have to use money earmarked for new soccer fields. Tyrone has just started a soccer program, which has about 150 players. But the fields at Shamrock Park are in such poor shape that Tyrone's soccer teams have to play matches elsewhere.
