For more than half a century, they knew each other only through letters. In August, a Dubuque woman and her German pen pal met in person.

 Mary Adele (Brimeyer) Houselog, 73, finally made it to Chemnitz, Germany, to talk to Rolf Wieders, 78, the man she has been writing to since she was a teenager and he was a young man. The two, now grandparents, were comfortable old friends at their first face-to-face meeting.

 Houselog was a junior at Dubuque&#146;s Immaculate Conception Academy in 1949 when a nun gave her the name and address of a young German man and urged her to start corresponding with him. Houselog does not remember if other girls started writing to Germans or why the teacher suggested the project, but she surmises it was to repair relationships between the two countries, badly damaged during World War II.

 Houselog and Wieders kept writing letters during major familial and political changes, relating details about school, work, children, illnesses and even death. Wieder&#146;s only child died suddenly as a young adult. For many years now, they have only exchanged Christmas cards.

 Houselog has saved most of Wieders&#146; letters. Several from 1949 are yellow with age, but Wieders&#146; fine handwriting is still easy to read and his English is passable. Both wrote in English since Houselog knows no German. In a 1949 Christmas card, Wieders lamented the lack of raisins and almonds which his family could no longer obtain, four years after the end of World War II. In another, he noted that his stamp collection was destroyed when his family home was bombed in the war.

 In a letter dated May 14, 1949, Wieders wrote about food rationing.

 &#145;&#145;Potatoes are free, but you cannot only live on potatoes. We get 1/2 pound of meat and 100 grams of butter within 10 days, but we have a garden which delivers us additional vegetables.&#146;&#146;

 Eventually Houselog and Wieders both married. She gave birth to seven children, he fathered one. In 1968, when her daughter, Janet, was 7, Houselog suggested she start writing to Wieders&#146; daughter Angelika, also 7. The two continued to correspond (and Janet visited her pen pal twice) until Angelika died unexpectedly in 1998.

 &#145;&#145;At first, I probably didn&#146;t even know where Germany was,&#146;&#146; said Janet Mabrey, who now lives in Arlington, Va. &#145;&#145;Her first letters were in German, so I took them to someone at Loras (College) to translate them.&#146;&#146; One of Angelika&#146;s longest and most emotional letters came in 1989, after the Berlin Wall came down.

 Houselog always wanted to meet her pen pal, but never made the trip and Wieders did not travel to the United States. Mabrey decided to get the two old friends together. She organized the trip and she and her siblings paid their mother&#146;s way.

 &#145;&#145;I thought if I didn&#146;t do it this year, who knows what could happen at their ages and I would always regret not getting them together,&#146;&#146; said Mabrey, 44, whose daughter Marisa Beckley, 15, went with her mother and grandmother.

 The Americans flew to Germany and arranged to meet the Wieders in Chemnitz. The two old pen pals shyly greeted each other and hugged reservedly. They introduced their respective families.

 &#145;&#145;I couldn&#146;t believe it. After all this time, I finally met my pen pal,&#146;&#146; Houselog said. She met all of Wieders&#146; family members, some of whom took the Americans to Berlin, Augustusburg and Dresden.

 The third generation of the pen pals&#146; families are now corresponding. Marisa Beckley writes to several of her counterparts in Wieders&#146; family.

 Decades of letter-writing between countries, even ones which were once bitter enemies, makes Houselog think that, &#145;&#145;We&#146;re all the same all over the world.&#146;&#146;
