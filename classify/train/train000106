U.S. District Court Judge James Thrash said it will be a disaster for Clayton County residents, but he will allow a federal discrimination lawsuit against Clayton Sheriff Victor Hill to move forward. "Just absolute disaster from the standpoint of public safety, the community and the county at large," Thrash said Friday when he decided to lift a stay on litigation in the case. He also called the situation a "litigation catastrophe." And while the case continues, Thrash will keep requiring Hill to seek the court's permission before promoting or hiring anyone in the Sheriff's Department.
