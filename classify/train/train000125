An overturned truck shut down all northbound lanes of I-85 near Newnan early Tuesday. Coweta County sheriff's dispatchers said the truck, which was hauling produce and apple juice, flipped over shortly after 4 a.m. on the I-85 bridge over Ga. 34. Dispatchers did not know if there were any serious injuries in the single-vehicle crash. Northbound traffic was being diverted off the interstate at the Ga. 34 exit ramp, then allowed to re-enter I-85 from the Ga. 34 entrance ramp.
