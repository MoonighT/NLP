Serenbe, the planned hamlet being built in south Fulton County, is developing on schedule. Construction is scheduled to begin in January on the community's centerpiece &mdash; a grassy town square and the Selborne Town Center. The town square is to measure 130 feet by 134 feet. It will provide a green vista by the Town Center, a 24,154-square-foot structure that will house a destination restaurant, shops and office space, art studio and media center and a recreational room. Construction cost for the lawn and building is set at $5 million. The site owned by former restaurateur Steve Nygren covers about 900 acres, and Nygren intends to keep at least 550 acres as undeveloped farmland and forest.
