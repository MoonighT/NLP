Two Smyrna women who lived alone within a mile of each other were killed by gunshots within days each other, police said Wednesday. The first victim, 44-year-old Kasi Peek, was found dead Oct. 2. She had been shot once and was discovered in her home at the Hillsdale Condominiums off Village Parkway and Windy Hill Road, police said. Her body was discovered after her estranged husband John Peek called police. John Peek said he had gone to the home to return some items to the victim, police said. The body of the second woman, whose home in the Davenport/Rose Garden section of Smyrna is less than a mile from Peek's condominium, was discovered Friday, but she was not declared a murder victim until early this week after a medical examiner discovered during an autopsy that she had shot to death, police said.
