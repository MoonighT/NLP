The Kennesaw City Council will consider an ordinance limiting where sex offenders can live within the city, after a resident complained this week that at least 10 such men were all living at the same Cobb Parkway extended-stay hotel. The offenders at the Superior Creek Lodge, 2945 Cobb Parkway, are all properly registered in the state's sex-offender database and have broken no laws, Kennesaw Police Chief Tim Callahan said. They did not violate state laws requiring them to maintain a safe distance from children, he said. After receiving complaints about the sex offenders, Mayor Leonard Church said he will ask the City Council to strengthen its ordinances to further limit sex offender residency possibilities.
