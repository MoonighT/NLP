The Clayton County sheriff's office Cobra Unit dug up the Riverdale yard of a suspected drug dealer Wednesday and found 15 pounds of crystal methamphetamine. The alleged dealer was arrested in June by Clayton police, sheriff's spokeswoman Sonna Singleton said. Singleton said Cobra officers acted on a tip from a Clayton County Jail inmate.
