Israeli troops lowered their nation's flag and snapped farewell photos in the final phase of the historic Gaza pullout Sunday, as thousands of Palestinian troops and gunmen assembled nearby, eager to take control after 38 years of Israeli occupation. The first army convoys left Gaza after sundown. Military jeeps and armored bulldozers drove slowly through the Kissufim crossing point, marking the beginning of the end of Israel's presence in Gaza. But the withdrawal, code-named "Last Watch," was overshadowed by Israeli-Palestinian disputes over border arrangements and Israel's last-minute decision not to demolish Gaza synagogues. The army canceled a handover ceremony when angry Palestinians said they wouldn't show up.
