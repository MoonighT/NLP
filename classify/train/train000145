With Marrying Up (Avon, 288 pages, $12.95 paper), Nina Foxx has written the kind of novel Terry McMillan would still be writing if she hadn't gotten rich. Foxx's heroine, Paris Montague, is a middle-class woman with upper-class aspirations. Status anxiety -- will she get promoted? Will she find a man who is rich enough to impress her mother? -- colors virtually everything she does and, it seems, governs the behavior of most everyone around her, too.
