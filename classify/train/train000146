 Quote: "This release marks the third time Heath Ledger's medieval joust adventure has landed in Digital Versatile Disc form. The gimmick this time? It's the extended cut, which in fact is simply the insertion of the deleted scenes from the previous versions into the feature. Everything else is pretty much the same."
