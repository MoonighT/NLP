Since Sarah Najour began her freshman year at East Coweta High School, she's learned that to get to math class on time a student must be resourceful. "You try walking out there in the halls and get here on time," said Sarah, who leaves lunch early and takes an outside shortcut to get to class. "It's impossible!" Consider that at East Coweta 2,100 students are enrolled in a school with hallways built for 1,000 and you get Sarah's drift.
