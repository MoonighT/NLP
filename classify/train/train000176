UH-OH: I'm not a lawyer and I've never been to law school. But even I know that there is no such thing as "the proportional representation requirement of the Equal Protection Clause" as it relates to the Voting Rights Act. It appears that Harriet Miers is more clueless in this respect than I am. That is a very low bar for the Supreme Court. If this is the state of play, the hearings could be excruciating.
