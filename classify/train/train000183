Book Reviews: Alan Alda had a good year in 2005, perhaps his best since "MASH" folded its TV tent. He was nominated for an Oscar for "The Aviator," a Tony for  "Glengarry Glen Ross" and an Emmy for "The West Wing." Granted, he didn't win any of them, but he declares in his smart, funny memoir that as he approaches 70 he feels "no pressure to succeed."
