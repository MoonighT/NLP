The Movie:

You know that "Tell Them Who You Are" is going to be something fascinating with the first scene, where legendary cinematographer Haskell Wexler leads the viewer around his equipment room. Off-camera, his son asks him to explain where they are and what they're looking at. Previously calm in discussing a piece of equipment in his hands, the elder Wexler turns around and verbally snaps his son's head off, explaining how not to do a documentary.

The interesting thing about the documentary is that it operates on two levels: on one hand, you get a lot of great insights and appreciation for Haskell Wexler's work from a wealth of stars and directors. On the other hand, you also get a movie about the son of a famous father trying to do the same thing and attempting to make a name for himself.
