The move to ban panhandling in much of downtown Atlanta has been swept up in the currents of race &mdash; currents that engulf so many political issues in the metropolitan area. Some critics of the proposal, including perennial candidate Dave Walker, have claimed the ordinance grows out of elitist efforts to sweep poor black people off the streets of downtown. At Tuesday's City Council Public Safety Committee hearing, Walker denounced the proposal as a plot between the council and the "white business structure" to "deny us the right to ask for alms." Walker's rhetoric notwithstanding, the legions of beggars who make downtown streets a gantlet are a nuisance not just for white workers and tourists, but for black visitors and office workers, as well. Speaking as a downtown worker who toils within a few blocks of the dirty, overrun Barbara Asher Square, I've mostly given up lunchtime walks in that direction, due east from the newspaper building.
