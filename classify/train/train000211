From: 20th Century Fox - Year: 2004 - Rated: NC-17 - Release Date: October 11, 2005 - Features: Anamorphic * Widescreen * Extras! *  - Recommended! For my money, Arrested Development manages to be among the best comedies on television right now, if not ever. It may take some time for new viewers to become accustom to the style of the show, but those who take the time to get to know the Bluth family will be well rewarded. Amazon Compare
