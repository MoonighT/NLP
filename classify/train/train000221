 
George W. Bush staged -- in other words "faked" --  a teleconference with the troops today.  Those of us who recognize the true means of this propagandist and liar aren't surprised in the least.  :

"WASHINGTON - It was billed as a conversation with U.S. troops, but the questions     President Bush asked on a teleconference call Thursday were choreographed to match his goals for the war in     Iraq and Saturday's vote on a new Iraqi constitution. 
 
"This is an important time," Allison Barber, deputy assistant defense secretary, said, coaching the soldiers before Bush arrived. "The president is looking forward to having just a conversation with you."
"

"Conversation?"  That's rich.

Now let me ask you Bush apologists a very simple question...  If you were given an assignment at your job, and you were caught staging or faking the results, you'd probably be fired, right?  If so, why does the man who holds the most important job in America get your apologies when you would never be given such latitude in your work.

You can read the whole bullshit discussion .  And by "bullshit," I mean "staged."
