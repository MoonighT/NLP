The two men campaigning for mayor of McDonough are very familiar with City Hall. Billy Copeland was mayor from 1978 to 1997. His opponent, Roger Pruitt, has been a city councilman for nearly three years. Each candidate believes he better understands the city and its needs. Now each must try to convince McDonough's 12,000 residents that he knows better how to deal with the city's main issues: managing growth, the widening of Jonesboro Road and the proposed South Point mall project.
