IInto The BlueI is the movie version of a Sports Illustrated calendar. There is no need to waste time on a good story when you have models strutting their stuff in excess. The dialogue by Matt Johnson, who also wrote ITorqueI, is so awful that you have to wonder how many writing classes he failed before hitting it big. When Bryce first meets Sam, he exclaims, Hey, can I get a what-what and a side of fries?
