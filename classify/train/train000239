Peachtree City Mayor Steve Brown predicts that his five opponents will challenge him on his honor, not his accomplishments. Brown says the prevailing question will be: Is the city obligated to repay loans made to the development authority? Loan defaults totaling about $1.5 million are at the heart of two lawsuits filed against the city by Peachtree National Bank, the Group VI development group and Foley Design Associates. Brown contends that the old development authority borrowed money illegally, so the city shouldn't be stuck with the debt.
