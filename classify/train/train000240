In Coweta County, residents are voting today  on a record $130 million special purpose local option sales tax to pay for new schools and refurbish existing ones. Although other metro Atlanta counties have passed larger sales tax initiatives, this is the largest sales tax referendum in Coweta's history. The county Board of Education is asking voters to extend the current 1 percent school sales tax, which expires in 2007, for another five years, which would produce an estimated $130 million. If voters approve, officials say they will build four new schools and facilities for three ninth-grade academies, expand and renovate existing campuses, and purchase new technology, school buses and land for future campuses.
