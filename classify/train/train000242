A preacher, a priest and a rabbi are sitting in a coffee shop with about 50 people from a wide variety of faiths. Their differences set aside, they sit for hours enjoying conversations that last well beyond the 90 minutes set aside for their meeting. No, this isn't the beginning of a joke. But it does lead into a true story about three men of faith who've put their theological differences aside to enjoy a unique fellowship. The gathering was held last month at the Village Veranda in Alpharetta, and the response to the event was so positive the three clergy members are moving the next meeting to a location that will accommodate a larger crowd.
