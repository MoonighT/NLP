Ford Motor Co. has extended the life span of the Taurus, manufactured at Ford's Hapeville plant, by adding five months to the production schedule. The company said Thursday the model will be assembled through August 2006. Ford had intended to phase out Taurus by next March. As a result, auto industry analyst Catherine Madden of Global Insight has raised her estimate of Tauruses coming off the line next year from 38,000 to at least 80,000. She also predicted Ford would sell the Taurus for "a rock-bottom price."
