Talk about a food fight. Roswell High School parents raising money for band instruments and tennis lights didn't know the mess they might be cooking up when they planned the "Taste of Roswell High School," a food-sampling event to be held on campus today. The Roswell Convention and Visitors Bureau stages the "Taste of Roswell." It registered the trademark name and logo last year and scheduled its event, also for today.
