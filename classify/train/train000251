The Were-Rabbit is a product of another disastrous experiment by Wallace, which will not surprise anyone familiar with the British series. For over ten years, creator Nick Park has created short films about a wacky inventor and his sidekick dog. In ICurse of the Were-RabbitI, they run a vegetable protection patrol called Anti-Pesto. Veggie-craving rabbits sneak into yards for buffets of produce, and the townspeople have joined together in outrage.
