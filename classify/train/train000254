 of Laura Bush's talk with Matt Lauer on the Today show, and says she didn't charge sexism in the way the MSM is suggesting:

"
In the deceptive version being pedaled by Reuters and the Post, they have Laura say sexism was possible and then repeat it for emphasis: "I think that's possible." This has the subtextual effect of making it appear certain that the First Lady was agreeing with Lauer's question, that critics were motivated by sexism.

But in reality, Lauer asked the question and paused; Mrs. Bush started to answer and was cut off by Lauer, who finished asking the question... so the First Lady, being a trouper, simply re-commenced her same answer. She did not say "that's possible... I think that's possible;" she dismissed the charge with a curt "that's possible," then started a new sentence on a different topic. 

Listening to the audio, it is clear that she was not agreeing with or even emphasizing the point. In fact, she was brushing it off. 

"

  She does sound like she's politely brushing the accusation off, but it's a shame that "sexism" made it into the talking points in the first place. How did that happen?
