Breast magnetic resonance imaging enhances patient selection for accelerated, partial breast irradiation by detecting previously unsuspected, microscopic lesions within the breast, according to a study presented October 17, 2005, at the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology's 47th Annual Meeting in Denver. The study shows that almost 10 percent of patients who had a breast MRI before completing breast conservation treatment had additional disease that was previously not seen on the patient's mammogram (breast X-ray).
