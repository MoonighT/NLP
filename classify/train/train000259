The Buddhist monks in the separatist south of Thailand  are facing increasing violence from guerrilla fighters. In response, a local armorer named Major Songphon Eiamboonyarith, who is called "Thailand's Q" has developed bulletproof "monkmobiles" and saffron-tinted bullet-proof vests. His other achievements include "umbrellas that shoot rubber bullets, bullet-proof baseball caps and a hand-held device to fire a man-sized net 30 feet (10 m) to stop a villain in his tracks."
