Possibly my favorite place in Tulsa.  Definitely my girlfriend's all-time favorite.  Every course of the meal is great, no matter what you get.  The presentation is excellent - every chef is on top of his game.  It's always fun sitting with other people, especially if they've never been there before.I've been there probably ten times and it's never been less than perfect.
