When the Rev. Gary Parrish officially retires June 19, he will have completed his 12th year as pastor of Newnan First United Methodist Church, an unusually long tenure for a Methodist pastor. Unlike many Protestant denominations, Methodist pastors are appointed to their pastorates, rather than being chosen by a congregation. A typical appointment might last five or six years. Parrish said appointments are getting longer, especially in larger congregations. "When I first started, pastors usually stayed about four years," he said. "But we're staying longer than we used to."
