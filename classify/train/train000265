Like so many teenage girls, Aubrae Gunderson's life was a mad dash of school and shopping and sports. Lots and lots and lots of sports. The Heritage High School sophomore nabbed a spot on her school's varsity cross country team when she was just a freshman and had blossomed into a strong midfielder on the Lady Patriots soccer team. Then there was the swimming and volleyball she squeezed in when she had time. "She was just driven," said her father, Daniel Gunderson of Covington. "Aubrae was the type you never had to remind to practice or ever talk her into it."
