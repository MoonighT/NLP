James Donald, the head of Georgia's prison system, has shown a willingness to tackle problems in the Department of Corrections. He is trying to restrain growth in the prison population &mdash; and save taxpayer money in the process &mdash; by stressing rehabilitation in hopes that there will be fewer repeat offenders. Alerted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to allegations that guards had beaten helpless inmates, Donald began a statewide investigation that resulted in the firing of guards at two prisons. Those are pluses for his leadership. Yet he has displayed an extraordinary lack of judgment elsewhere. He sent state employee associations in search of donations from private industry &mdash; including prison system vendors &mdash; for a major corrections employee conference. In doing so, he ignored red flags raised within the Department of Corrections and by Gov. Sonny Perdue's office. More than $100,000 was solicited from businesses to help finance the prisoner rehabilitation conference last fall. A complaint about the solicitation was made and investigated by the GBI. Some of the vendors who were asked to donate felt pressured to do so, according to a subsequent report by the GBI. At the time, Donald was looking at possible changes in how the Department of Corrections awards contracts to vendors.
