If you're fortunate enough to have a movie theater close to you playing Napoleon Dynamite, then don't pass up the chance to see this off-beat comedy. It's pretty frickin hilarious. I can't remember a film that had me laughing through most of it. Check out the film's web site for more info. (Oh, and it's a heavy Flash site too.)
