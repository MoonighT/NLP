Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) doesn't need to make a payment of about $160 million payment to a pension plan for pilots under a union contract and can also skip about $7 million a month in direct payments to highly compensated retirees. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Prudence Carter Beatty shot down arguments from attorneys for retired pilots and the Air Line Pilots Association who said she should force Delta to make the pension payments or start proceedings to change or cancel its collective bargaining agreement with ALPA. Delta attorney Marshall Huebner said Beatty's ruling was clearly against the Delta Pilots' Pension Preservation Organization. However, many in the courtroom were confused when Beatty came back from a recess, announced that she had ruled against the motions, and then quickly adjourned a Monday afternoon hearing.
