    Sun Microsystems has published an early draft of JSR 261 - Java API for XML Web Services Addressing (JAX-WSA) for review to the JCP. "The Java APIs for XML-based Web Services Addressing (JAX-WSA) 1.0 specification will define APIs and a framework for supporting transport-neutral addressing of Web services. JAX-WSA will align with JSR 224 (Java API for XML-based RPC 2.0) to define this API and the framework."
