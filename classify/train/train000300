DVD Reviews: One of the most beloved shows of the past 30 years, but you'd never know it from this features-barren boxed set of the show's first season. Devoid of original content,  collection is something of an insult to the series that saved a network, put indie Carsey-Werner on the map and proved that Americans could be color-blind when it came to great comedy.
