We're not running out of oil. Not yet. Prices above $60 a barrel, driven by high demand growth, are fueling the fear of imminent shortage &mdash; that the world is going to begin running out of oil in five or 10 years. This shortage, it is argued, will be amplified by the substantial and growing demand from two giants: China and India. Yet this fear is not borne out by the fundamentals of supply. Our new, field-by-field analysis of production capacity is quite at odds with the current view and leads to a strikingly different conclusion: There will be a large, unprecedented buildup of oil supply in the next few years. Between 2004 and 2010, capacity to produce oil (not actual production) could grow by 16 million barrels a day &mdash; from 85 million barrels per day to 101 million barrels a day &mdash; a 20 percent increase, relieving pressure on supply and demand.
