Walking distance from our hotel, I was able to talk my coworkers into trying it out. All of us agreed (even those that had never tried Indian cuisine) that it was exceptional. My guideline as to if it is good and authentic Indian is if my tummy can handle it or not.I'll let you find out on your own. :)This was some good food, adequate portions, with just enough spicy heat to break the sweat when requesting mild. Very attentive, making sure our water and drink glass were full.Recommended. The Orlando Weekly review & more detailed info: http://www.orlandoweekly.com/dining/place.asp?id=3465
