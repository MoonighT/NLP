Sandy Springs transition leader Oliver Porter is drawing criticism for asking unnamed City Council candidates to drop out so runoff elections might be avoided. Mayoral candidate Tim Spruell said the request shows Porter would sacrifice democracy for the sake of expediency. "This is supposed to be a democratic society, and democracy means choice," said Spruell, who is opposing pro-city movement leader Eva Galambos in a race that will be decided without a runoff.
