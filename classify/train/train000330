The state Senate's Eminent Domain Study Committee headed by Sen. Jeff Chapman (R-Brunswick) got a tough welcome Friday from Stockbridge City Manager Ted Strickland. Chapman brought the committee to town for its latest public hearing because Stockbridge has become the epicenter of the fight over using eminent domain &mdash; condemning property &mdash; in Georgia. The city, like many around metro Atlanta, is hoping to create a new, vibrant downtown that will attract a second wave of development. City leaders envision new shops, offices and residents in houses and townhomes on 22 acres that the city and the city Urban Redevelopment Agency are purchasing or condemning.
