Sure, the witch sold us out and interviewed with The New Yorker first.  (She told us last week that she couldn't do OUR interview until today because she was "busy" - busy, my scatalogy.  She was just waiting for the New Yorker to scoop us.  But we're not bitter.  Perhaps she's still pissed at me about that RADAR column I wrote about her.)

Anyway, the interview is in a few hours and I'm looking for questions, good probing questions.

Got any?  Best questions make it into my interview.
