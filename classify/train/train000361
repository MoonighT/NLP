Combatants in the battle over the controversial No Child Left Behind law await next week's state-by-state test scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Both sides seek ammunition to bolster their views. Parents, educators and others hoping to learn whether NCLB helps or harms education will need to work hard to find answers amid the welter of numbers and spin. The NAEP results will be based on reading and math tests given to a sample of students at grades four and eight in every state. In theory, by looking at an independent national measure we can learn whether children are actually gaining knowledge or merely being drilled to improve scores on their state's exams. If the past is any guide, expect an onslaught of cherry-picked statistics from officials eager to justify high-stakes testing policies. As always, it is important to examine the data, rather than accept official sound bites.
