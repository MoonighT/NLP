The tiny town of Stone Mountain lies in the shadow of the giant rock that shares its name. Nearby Stone Mountain Park gets all the tourists with its hiking trails, railroad ride and kitschy shops, but to many, Stone Mountain the city is just another exit off U.S. 78. Yes, there's Main Street, a blocks-long strip of antiqueries that draws curiosity seekers on weekends, but even residents admit it needs updating. Its droopy awnings and faded two-story buildings conjure up Dodge City, not the downtown Decatur they want it to be.
