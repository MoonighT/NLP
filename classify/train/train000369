Tim Jarrell is the President of Students for Democracy at WMU (Western Michigan University) in Kalamazoo, MI.

Our GenerationDFA group was really excited about the opportunity that Democracy for America offered us to attend the Foo Fighters concert in Grand Rapids,MI and spread the word about our work. We all agreed that it is awesome that the Foo Fighters are big DFA supporters and are willing to help out by letting GenerationDFA groups promote themselves at their concerts throughout the country.

We were swimming in uncharted waters, because this concert was in one of the most conservative areas of the state. But we managed to use this to our advantage. Our location gave us the opportunity to actually talk to people who did not fully understand our convictions. There were many great responses from people who we had a chance to speak with.

Our GenerationDFA group teamed up with Campus Progress members from Notre Dame to work our booth&#151;which was in a prime location. We were in the main concourse right by the stairs which everyone came up when they entered the arena. Being in this spot gave us the opportunity to talk to tons of people as they came into the show and pass out DFA stickers as they left. We all took turns watching the awesome concert and everyone had a great time.

Thank you DFA and the Foo Fighters!
