With a record $130 million sales-tax-for-schools vote days away, Coweta County Superintendent Blake Bass is not being bashful with his election prediction. "We're going to pass the SPLOST," Bass said. "People understand that this is more than just a vote for new schools; it's an investment in Coweta County." Coweta leaders never have asked voters for so much money to build and refurbish classrooms &mdash; or anything else, for that matter. But Bass and others say they're not worried about voters being turned off by the cost of the referendum. The vote will take place Tuesday.
