Acting as visionary for the rapidly developing northeast corner of Fulton County called Johns Creek, Geoff Berlin is consumed with getting quality-of-life infrastructure in place. Two main projects are a community playhouse and greenways linking neighborhoods and commercial areas. He'll tell you officially: "My real focus is on bringing culture to the area." But in truth, he says, he wants to live in a place where he can ride his bike a couple of miles to go to the theater.
