The genome of another micro-organism which lives under extreme conditions has been sequenced. Scientists at the Department of Membrane Biochemistry at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry have analysed the genome of Natronomonas pharaonis and uncovered the survival strategies with which the archaeon can best thrive in deadly environmental conditions. In the latest edition of the international journal Genome Research, Professor Dieter Oesterhelt and his colleagues present their research.
