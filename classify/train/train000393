Robert Boesch has been a student at Starr's Mill High School for less than a month, but already he's become a member of the football team and taken a date to homecoming. "We introduced him at a pep rally, and he got a standing ovation," said head football coach Mike Earwood. "There's 1,700 students here. I'm not sure all of them know him, but a lot of them do." Boesch, 18, has been a hit with the football team &mdash; not to mention the girls &mdash; since he arrived as a displaced student from New Orleans. Starr's Mill, from which Boesch expects to graduate in May, has been a hit with him, too.
