Delta Air Lines will cut up to 650 more jobs and shed up to 30 jets at its regional carrier Comair as part of its bankruptcy reorganization. The plans announced Thursday, which Delta said will cut annual costs by up $70 million at the Cincinnati-based subsidiary, follow on the heels of Delta's decision last month to shrink its Cincinnati hub by about 26 percent in December and shed about 1,000 mainline and Comair jobs at the airport. Comair said it is also seeking pay cuts and other concessions from its unionized pilots, flight attendants and mechanics targeted at saving about $27 million annually.
