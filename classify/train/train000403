Henry County police making a drug raid last week burst into the wrong house, roused a couple from bed and handcuffed the man. "We dropped the ball," Henry Police Chief Russ Abernathy said Wednesday. "It was inexcusable, not acceptable. Things like this do happen, but it is not supposed to happen to us." Early Friday morning, SWAT and narcotics officers intended to raid the house of Scott Andrew McIntyre, whom officers suspected of swapping methamphetamine for objects such as guns, collectible knives and swords.
