As I've noted elsewhere, you can always get a great deal on eBay auctions by searching for misspelled listings (e.g. "plam pilot"). Now there's a site, MisspelledAuctions.com, that mines eBay for misspelled versions of the keywords you enter. Worked like a charm on my "Disney" query, turning up lots of "diney" and "dinsey" auctions.
