More than 300 firefighters from as far away as Alaska will converge on Clayton County this weekend to sweat and strain in the Firefighter Combat Challenge National Championship. Firefighters will compete in five tasks commonly performed in emergency situations: a five-story tower climb while wearing full gear and carrying a 50-pound hose pack; hoisting another hose pack up the tower; driving a 165-pound steel beam 5 feet with a sledge hammer; advancing a heavy fire hose 100 feet; and simulating a rescue by dragging a 185-pound mannequin 100 feet. ESPN has televised the event by tape delay since 1993. Local residents can watch the free two-day event in Morrow. Proceeds from the event will benefit the local Rainbow House, Hurricane Katrina victims and the Clayton County Fire Department.
