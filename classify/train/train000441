 Ann Hornaday's Sept. 26 Style review of "No Direction Home" mischaracterized Martin Scorsese's work on the film. Mr. Scorsese was brought in to shape existing film footage. He didn't conduct any interviews or shoot any film, nor did he "wisely" decide to limit the film's scope to 1961-66; that was part of his assignment.
