Hapeville soon will be adding more greenery to its downtown and is organizing fund-raisers to help with the project. More than 50 ornamental trees are to be planted along the South Central rail line from Custer Street to just past the intersection with Virginia Avenue. "Planting trees is one of the most effective ways to buffer the railways," said Hapeville Main Street Manager Anna George.
