Regardless what a Texas jury decides about the guilt or innocence of Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), the district attorney in the case has already attained his political aims. Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle, a loyal Democrat, has had DeLay in his cross hairs for years. Earle patiently went through six grand juries to finally achieve the indictment. At a recent Democratic fund-raiser, Earle bragged to the crowd that he was the man who was going to bring down DeLay. And sure enough, by corrupting the levers of justice, Earle has managed to force DeLay to relinquish his majority leader post.
