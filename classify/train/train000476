Another of Cameron Crowe?s heart-warmers in which a young man discovers himself during a journey. Orlando Bloom stars as a shoe designer considering suicide after a spectacular design failure. His father dies during a homecoming visit to Kentucky, and Bloom flies out for the funeral. On an otherwise deserted airplane, he meets a flight attendant (Kirsten Dunst) in what can only be described as a Meet Cute or Die. She insists on entering his life, and a good thing, too, because she saves it. Susan Sarandon plays the widow, still blamed by the locals for kidnapping her husband and spiriting him away to the coast. Not one of Crowe?s great films like ?Almost Famous,? but sweet and good-hearted and with some real laughs. Note: Crowe shortened the movie by 18 minutes after its Toronto Film Festival debut, much improving it in the process.
