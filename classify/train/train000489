Iraqi leaders called an end to negotiations and declared their draft constitution complete Sunday, despite objections from Sunni Muslims, whose support had been seen as important for countering the ongoing insurgency. Lawmakers read the text to the National Assembly in a live broadcast to Iraqis, who had been watching with increasing frustration as the talks stretched past the original Aug. 15 deadline. The assembly took no vote on the document, but Iraqi leaders said none was required. The move sets the stage for a national referendum by Oct. 15 on whether to adopt the constitution. The National Assembly was scheduled to start debating laws governing the vote today.
