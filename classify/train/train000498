If you bake a cake, you start by checking the 'best before' date on the cake mix, smelling the milk to ensure it's still good, and looking at the eggs when cracking them open.

In comparison, how many companies check the PDF documents they receive from external (or other internal) sources before entering them into business processes, where the cost of failure is considerably higher?
