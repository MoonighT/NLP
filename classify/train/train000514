This cute kitty in Dobson, North Carolina was born with two tongues and five toes on each paw. The cat's name is Five Toes. From Local6.com:

Owner Bill Whittington told a North Carolina TV station that he noticed the cat's second tongue in December. He said he yelled when he saw the tongues flicker...

Whittington said Ripley's Believe It Or Not will feature Five Toes in its 2006 guide.
