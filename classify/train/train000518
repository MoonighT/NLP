We went to finally see the sequel to The Bourne Identity (based on the Bourne series by Robert Ludlam). I really liked the first one, but Supremacy surpassed its predecessor by a long shot. You may have heard already that it's got one of the best car chases ever put to film, and I have to agree. The cinematography, production design and art director is top notch. I wouldn't be surprised if I went to see it again. If you've seen it, post your review too!
