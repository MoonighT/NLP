Saddam Hussein's nephew, Yasir Sabhawi Ibrahim, has been arrested in Baghdad.  He was reputed to be the chief financier of terrorism in Iraq.  That's great news.  Even better news is that Syria kicked Ibrahim out of the country, then told Iraqi authorities where to find him.  The rate of progress in Iraq seems to be accelerating.
