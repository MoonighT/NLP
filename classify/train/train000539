The bodies of a Stockbridge man and his mother, missing for a week following a visit to Yosemite National Park, were found Thursday night in their wrecked rental car, just outside the California park's eastern entrance. Xiaodong Yuan, a 34-year-old computer analyst who lived with his wife and sons in Henry County, and his 60-year-old mother, Zhaohui Wang, flew to Las Vegas on Sept. 20, then drove to Yosemite. Yuan called his wife on Sept. 22, telling her they were planning to leave Yosemite the following morning to drive back to Las Vegas. That was the last contact family members had with Yuan and his mother, who was visiting the United States from China.
