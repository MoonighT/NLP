The state Board of Pardons and Paroles has released the second of two Conyers men who as teenagers received nine-year prison terms for vandalizing a Rockdale County elementary school. Bryan Lee Grantham, now 19, served almost four years in custody before his release Tuesday. He and Rex Terry Newman pleaded guilty to causing more than $250,000 in damage at J.H. House Elementary School in 2001. They were jailed for about seven months before Superior Court Judge Sidney Nation sentenced them to the prison time followed by 11 years of probation.
