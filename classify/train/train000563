A bank robbery suspect also wanted for the shooting of a police officer was killed and an FBI agent wounded Thursday morning during a shootout at a Conyers hotel. Conyers police spokeswoman Jennifer Edwards said the FBI contacted Conyers police Wednesday regarding suspects from an armed robbery and assault on a police officer that occurred Monday near Columbus. The suspects, Malik Salman Elawad and Morgan Chigawa, were among six who allegedly held up a Regions Bank in Phenix City, Ala., then shot Columbus police Lt. Mark D. Starling in the arm when he confronted them in the parking lot of the Peachtree Mall, according to reports in the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer newspaper.
