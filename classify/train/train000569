When Jose Ramos stepped to the microphone at a legislative hearing recently, he nervously told about 100 people that he&#146;d never spoken in front of a crowd so large.

Then he made an eloquent plea to members of the New Iowans Study Committee to help more of the state&#146;s talented Latino students go to college. Most who are legal residents need financial aid, he said. Most who are undocumented face a closed door to pursuing their dreams.

Ramos came to Iowa to work in a packing plant and now is editor and publisher of a Spanish-language newspaper. His success story typified those of a parade of speakers &#8212; entrepreneurs, factory workers, parents, students &#8212; at East High School in Des Moines. They emphasized that today&#146;s immigrants want nothing more than what other Iowans do: good jobs, good schools and a safe place to raise their families.
