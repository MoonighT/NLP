This disc is a desperate plea for cash from Disney in the worst way. Unfortunately they arent giving consumers anything worth buying with this release. With so many excellent DVDs being put out by Disney studios these days, something of this poor quality is just unacceptable, especially for a release thats breaking the studios self-declared moratorium. Although the fans who missed the opportunity to purchase ITarzanI five years ago will be thankful to see this, I think its disgusting to see Disney rip off fans like this. This, despite the high quality of the transfer, the beautiful picture and awesome sound, this disc gets the lowest rating I can possibly give a DVD release.
