 Quote: "The real selling point here is the new DVD presentation. Starting with a wonderfully sick packaging concept (the front cover art is encased in plastic, and fake blood and a saw blade float around in it like some kind of sinister snow globe), this two-disc set really tries to flesh out the Saw experience."
