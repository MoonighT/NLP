The mother and sister of an alleged Clayton County gang leader pleaded guilty Monday to lying to federal agents investigating his involvement in the 2004 shooting death of a toddler at a Riverdale park. Lawanna Davis, 43, and her daughter, Natasha Anthony, 24, both of Riverdale, entered an Alford plea as first offenders to making false statements, said Clayton Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney John Turner. An Alford plea means the defendant maintains his or her innocence but believes the state can present enough evidence at trial to ensure a conviction. Davis' son, Cori Davis, 21, is the leader of the "Southside Mafia," Turner said, and is being held in the Clayton County Jail on a murder charge in the June 6, 2004, shooting death of Trevon Wilson, 4.
