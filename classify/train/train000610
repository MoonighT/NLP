From: 20th Century Fox - Year: 2005 - Rated: PG-13 - Release Date: November 01, 2005 - Features: Anamorphic * Widescreen * DD 5.1 * Extras! *  - Recommended! The wait is over - the Star Wars saga is finally complete on DVD, and Revenge of the Sith is nothing short of stunning. With each release in the series, Lucasfilm has set the visual and audio quality standard against which all other DVDs are judged, and this time is no different.  The picture and sound are likely better than you experienced in the theater and all of the bonus features are actually worth watching (an achievement in and of itself). Amazon Compare
