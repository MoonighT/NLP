Well I'm relieved, because after all, that's half the battle. What I really want to know is whether she is a dog person or a cat person, and what is her favorite Britney Spears album. Come on! Other than the scary butt-kissing correspondence to the most brilliant person ever, I don't think anyone has really been attacking the woman personally. Whether or not she is a nice person or functional party guest probably won't make a bit of difference as to her abilities as a supreme court justice. The elephant is still sitting in the middle of the room - she may be an excellent corporate lawyer and personal attorney, but there is no way this person would have been nominated if she hadn't been Bush's friend."
