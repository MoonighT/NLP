President Bush said Thursday that the war in Iraq is a crucial front in a battle against Muslim extremists seeking "a radical Islamic empire that spans from Spain to Indonesia." "Some might be tempted to dismiss these goals as fanatical or extreme," Bush said. "Well, they are fanatical and extreme and they should not be dismissed." In making his case during what the White House billed as a major speech, Bush said the United States and other nations had "disrupted" at least 10 "serious al-Qaida terrorist plots" since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, including three aimed at the United States.
