The pizza I had at Bambino's Pizzeria was awesome. I had the Italiano Deluxe and the Bambino's Special. I truly recommend these, you can really taste all the flavors. All my friends had been raving about Bambino's and I finally understand why. Everyone was so nice and the place was very very clean.
