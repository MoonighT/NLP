First Bush decides to "help" the recovery in Louisiana by making it legal for companies to pay substandard wages, even though the massive rebuilding effort needed after Hurricane Katrina should mean builders and laborers would be in high demand. Then we find out that most of the contracts are going to out-of-state companies. 

Finally, and you can't make this up, USA Today reports that Halliburton subcontracted out work to companies that fired some 75 union electricians and then hired at least 10 illegal immigrants in their place. And where were they working? A naval base near New Orleans.

Five years into their regime, and Cheney and his pals can still surprise you with their nastiness and craven greed.
