Henry County police are helping look for a missing Palm Harbor, Fla., woman whose car was found Tuesday on I-75. A silver 2002 Mercedes SLK driven by Chong Chapman, 40, was found abandoned on northbound I-75, said police Lt. Jason Bolton. A search near the area turned up Chapman's purse containing cash and personal items, including her driver's license. Her dog was found alive in the car but ran onto the highway and was killed, Bolton said. Chapman is 5 feet 2 inches tall, Bolton said. Chapman checked out of the Red Roof Inn off I-75 in Locust Grove Sept. 20, though police don't know why she was there or where she was heading.
