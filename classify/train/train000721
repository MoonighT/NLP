It may take a few years, but Clayton County government probably will end up with fewer departments. The Clayton County Commission this month will begin considering a study by the University of Georgia's Carl Vinson Institute of Government that recommends streamlining the county's government structure. The study, which cost the county $35,000, recommends consolidating some departments.
