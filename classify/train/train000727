The question everybody's been asking is: who was the source who leaked Valerie Plame's identity to Judy Miller? And the answer? She cannot recall. Given the "gee-whiz, it all just sort of, like, happened, and I don't know when or why or where or who..." tone of her mea no culpa , maybe Judy is vying for a role on MTV's "Laguna Beach." Which is just as well, because if these two articles have revealed anything at all, it's that Judy Miller is no journalist. Read my whole take HERE. 

But there was more than Judy Miller to puzzle over this week: Did Karl Rove find that after four visits to the grand jury, practice makes perfect? And what, exactly, was the president talking about when he told Harriet Miers, "No more public scatology"? Check out some of the best of this week's blogs below, plus indispensable takes on Plamegate from Jane Hamsher, Mark Kleiman, and Jeralyn Merritt.
