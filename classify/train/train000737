The current standard of care for early-stage breast cancer is breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) to remove the tumor followed by radiation and hormone therapy to kill any remaining cells. Physicians in Austria tested whether patients were more likely to have their cancer return if radiation therapy was removed from the mix. They found that radiation therapy combined with hormone therapy after surgery is more effective in keeping the cancer from returning, according to a study presented at the ASTRO Annual Meeting.
