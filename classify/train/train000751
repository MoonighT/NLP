Iraqi leaders moved to the brink of agreement on a constitution Sunday, solving several contentious issues but still struggling with the potentially explosive questions of Shiite autonomy and the role of Islam in family disputes and the judiciary. The Iraqis said they were hoping to finish the constitution by the end of the day today, a deadline that they have already extended once. They scheduled a meeting of the National Assembly for this evening, when they hoped to present a finished constitution for approval. Negotiators said they had agreed on a formula to share Iraq's oil wealth, which had been one of the most difficult issues. The agreement was being shepherded with the help of U.S. officials and especially Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad. After more than 12 hours of talks Sunday, a senior American official said a deal was almost in hand.
