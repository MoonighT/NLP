One of the worst expirences at a restaurant I have evver had. First thing you walk in the door and bamn you are back in the '70s. The steak was bland and tough, the soup was luke warm and again bland. The service was bad so and over-all disappointing expirence. I would recomend not going there if you desire eating good food.
