The future of the Georgia landscape and the character of rural communities are at stake as Congress begins to look toward adopting the next farm bill in 2007. A healthy agricultural sector is the foundation for the economy of most of Georgia. Increasingly, the work of farmers, ranchers and private forest-owners will be valued not just for  commodities, but for clean water and air, healthy soil, improved wildlife habitat, and wide-open space enjoyed by all Georgians. That's the message Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) and Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns will hear Tuesday in Moultrie, where they will host a listening session on the reauthorization of the farm bill.
