It's been talked about for years. School board members are constantly assailed by it: the perception that north Fulton schools get favored treatment over south Fulton schools. That kids in the northern part of the county get a better education, better facilities, access to better resources including computers, library books and better trained teachers. School board members hotly deny any favoritism. In response to skeptical south Fulton residents, school officials published a report this year showing that the district spends more per pupil in south county schools than in the north. But a group of nine East Point and College Park students who spend their days in those schools &mdash; about half in north Fulton and half in south Fulton &mdash; say the issues aren't that transparent. The disparities they see don't always come down to dollars on a central office spreadsheet.
