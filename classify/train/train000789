Roswell and Fulton County on Thursday reached a mediated deal on spending in unincorporated areas, which will prevent the county and its 10 cities from losing tens of millions of dollars in grants next year. The deal concludes a long and contentious dispute between the county and its second-biggest city over how Fulton allocates money &mdash; mostly for road projects &mdash; in unincorporated areas. Roswell wanted Fulton to stop using general funds for roads in unincorporated areas, because unincorporated residents don't help pay for roads in Roswell. Roswell Mayor Jere Wood has been trying for years to get the county to renegotiate the deal under which road money is allocated &mdash; known as the services delivery strategy &mdash; but the county has refused, saying roads in unincorporated areas benefit everyone.
