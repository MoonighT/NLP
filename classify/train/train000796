Forty-six years ago, the impassioned efforts of schoolchildren helped Velma "Wild Horse Annie" Johnston succeed in getting the first law passed to protect America's wild herds. The Wild Horse Annie Act, banning the use of motorized vehicles to hunt wild horses and burros on public lands, was enacted Sept. 8, 1959. Today, another Johnston and another group of children are writing letters and raising funds to save wild horses from the slaughterhouse. Thanks in no small part to such efforts, the U.S. Senate on Sept. 20 passed one of several legislative actions on their behalf. Christine Johnston, head instructor and trainer at the Atlanta Riding Club in Canton, has been sharing the story of the wild horses' plight with the 7- to 14-year-old riders at the center's summer camp.
