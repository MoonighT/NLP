A Chronicle of FEMA's Internal Interactions on the Evening of Aug. 31, 2005 (2 days Post-Katrina)

Marty Bahamonde, the New England FEMA regional director and FEMA's only body in the Superdown, e-mailed Michael Brown, then-FEMA director and point person in Baton Rouge, to tell him that thousands of evacuees were gathering in the streets with no food or water and that "estimates are many will die within hours."  He continues, "Sir, I know that you know the situation is past critical...The sooner we can get the medical patients out, the sooner we can get them out."

Micheal Brown's press secretary, Sharon Worthy, e-mailed her colleagues:

"He [Michael Brown] needs much more than 20 or 30 minutes [to eat dinner].  Restaurants are getting busy.  We now have traffic to encounter to get to and from a location of his choice, followed by wait service from the restaurant staff, eating, etc. Thank you."
"

Bahamonde messaged a co-worker:

"OH MY GOD!!!!!!! I just ate an MRE [military rations] and crapped in the hallway of the Superdome along with 30,000 other close friends so I understand her concern about busy restaurants."
"

This chronicle demonstrates why my disgust cannot be put into the appropriate words.  I can only support the sentiment expressed by Bahamonde in an e-mail on September 3rd. "The leadership from top down in our agency is unprepared and out of touch. ... I am horrified at some of the cluelessness and self concern that persists."
