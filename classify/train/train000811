 I agree with the Oct. 4 editorial "Imported Drugs and the Law" about Montgomery County Council President Tom Perez's pursuit of legislation to allow the importation of drugs from Canada despite federal law to the contrary. However, the editorial did not go far enough in pointing out the danger of a government knowingly breaking the law.
