 On successive days this month, two democratic dissidents embraced by the Bush administration on opposite sides of the world were shoved into the same legal twilight zone, a virtual holding tank of menace and uncertainty that despots often find useful. Maria Corina Machado of Venezuela and Ayman Nour of Egypt were charged with crimes carrying heavy prison sentences; court proceedings were begun. But their final trial sessions then were left pending, in the case of Machado, or postponed for several months, in the case of Nour. That leaves them to twist in the wind this summer while their governments -- Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and Hosni Mubarak's Egypt -- measure the mettle of President Bush.
